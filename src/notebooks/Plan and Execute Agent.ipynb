The Guardians cannot heal Rocket\\'s wounds with their med-packs due to a kill switch embedded in him by Orgocorp, a company helmed by a mad scientist and Rocket\\'s creator, the High Evolutionary. The Guardians travel to Orgocorp\\'s headquarters to find the switch\\'s override code and save Rocket\\'s life.\\\\nAs Rocket lies unconscious, he recalls his past. As a baby raccoon, he was experimented on by the High Evolutionary, who sought to enhance and anthropomorphize animal lifeforms to create an ideal society called Counter-Earth. Rocket befriended his fellow Batch 89 test subjects: the otter Lylla, the walrus Teefs, and the rabbit Floor. The High Evolutionary was impressed by Rocket\\'s rapidly growing intelligence but became furious once it exceeded his own. The High Evolutionary used Rocket to perfect his Humanimal creations, then planned to harvest Rocket\\'s brain for further research and exterminate the obsolete Batch 89. Rocket freed his friends, but the High Evolutionary killed Lylla. Enraged, Rocket mauled the High Evolutionary, but his henchmen killed Teefs and Floor during a firefight with Rocket, before the latter fled Counter-Earth in a spaceship.\\\\nIn the present, the Ravagers, including an alternate version of Gamora, help the Guardians infiltrate Orgocorp. They retrieve Rocket\\'s file but discover that the code was removed, with the likely culprit being Theel, one of the High Evolutionary\\'s advisors. The Guardians, along with Gamora, depart for Counter-Earth to find him. They are followed by Ayesha and Adam after the High Evolutionary, their race\\'s creator, threatened to wipe out the Sovereign if they fail to retrieve Rocket. The Guardians reach Counter-Earth and are guided to the Ar\\\\u00eate Laboratories complex. Drax and Mantis remain with Gamora and Rocket as Peter Quill, Groot, and Nebula travel to Ar\\\\u00eate. Nebula is forced to wait outside by guards as Quill and Groot enter Ar\\\\u00eate, while Drax tricks Mantis into pursuing Quill\\'s group. Gamora saves Rocket from being captured by Adam and the High Evolutionary\\'s guard War Pig.\\\\nQuestioned by Quill, the High Evolutionary admits disillusionment with the Animen\\'s imperfect society.\\\\nTriplets:\\\\n\"], \"model\": \"text-davinci-002\", \"temperature\": 0.0, \"max_tokens\": 256, \"top_p\": 1, \"frequency_penalty\": 0, \"presence_penalty\": 0, \"n\": 1, \"logit_bias\": {}}' message='Post details'\n",

Vol. 3 fulfills a character arc for the character writer and director James Gunn envisioned when starting work on Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), going from a minor villain to a member of the Guardians. Although the film teases a possible romance between Star-Lord and Nebula, Gunn denies having ever considered the two becoming a couple, though Gillan does believe she harbors a small crush on Quill.\\\\nPom Klementieff as Mantis: A member of the Guardians with empathic powers, and Quill\\'s half-sister.\\\\nVin Diesel as the voice of Groot: A member of the Guardians who is a tree-like humanoid and the accomplice of Rocket. Austin Freeman provided the motion-capture for Groot.\\\\nBradley Cooper as Rocket:A member of the Guardians and a former Avenger who is a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter and a master of weapons and military tactics. Gunn said that the film tells Rocket\\'s story, including his background and \\\\\"where he\\'s going\\\\\", along with how that ties into the other Guardians and the end of this iteration of the team. The film completes a character arc that was established in Guardians of the Galaxy and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), and continued in Infinity War and Endgame. Sean Gunn once again provided on set motion capture for the character, while also voicing young Rocket. Cooper also voiced adolescent Rocket while Noah Raskin voiced baby Rocket.\\\\nWill Poulter as Adam Warlock:A powerful artificial being created by the Sovereign to destroy the Guardians.

Maria Bakalova reprises her voice and motion capture role from the Holiday Special as Cosmo, a member of the Guardians who is a sapient dog that developed psionic abilities after being abandoned in outer space by the Soviet Union. Gunn changed Cosmo\\'s gender from male, as depicted in the comics, to female for the film, as a tribute to the character\\'s original inspiration, Laika, a Soviet space dog who became one of the first animals in space. Cosmo was physically portrayed by dog actor Slate, after also doing so for the Holiday Special, and was previously portrayed by dog actor Fred in the first two Guardians films.

By mid-June, Gunn had completed the first draft of his script treatment for the third film, and was considering changing a piece of character info he had placed in the background of the mugshot sequence in the first film (when the Guardians are captured by the Nova Corps).

Gunn said in February 2020 that bringing Yondu back to life would \\\\\"nullify Yondu\\'s sacrifice\\\\\" in Vol. 2, and said the character would not return unless it was for a prequel or flashback; Gunn later said Yondu would not be resurrected in the film to not diminish his death\\'s meaning.\\\\nTriplets:\\\\n\"], \"model\": \"text-davinci-002\", \"temperature\": 0.0, \"max_tokens\": 256, \"top_p\": 1, \"frequency_penalty\": 0, \"presence_penalty\": 0, \"n\": 1, \"logit_bias\": {}}' message='Post details'\n",

An early option Gunn had in mind for the character who would become the film\\'s main villain and be revealed to be the one who created Rocket was the Fantastic Four villain Annihilus, but Gunn ultimately opted to fill that role with the High Evolutionary. Gunn originally wrote a cameo appearance for Kumail Nanjiani, a friend of his, but removed this after learning Nanjiani was cast as Kingo in Marvel Studios\\' Eternals (2021).By late August, Gunn and Marvel Studios began meeting with actors for the role of Adam Warlock, including Will Poulter. George MacKay was also on the shortlist and Reg\\\\u00e9-Jean Page was considered for the part. Poulter auditioned for the role over Zoom before an in-person screen test with Gunn in Atlanta. When first auditioning for Warlock, Poulter was unaware of who his character\\'s name was other than he had been teased at the post-credits scene of Vol. 2, but Marvel just described the role to him as \\\\\"an untitled character\\\\\" until Poulter was \\\\\"drip-fed\\\\\" with more information over and over until discovering how steeped Adam Warlock is in the source material. In September, Gillan reiterated her positive comments about the script and said the film would explore the characters from the previous Guardians films on a deeper level, while Seth Green, who voices Howard the Duck in the MCU, said the film would be about Gamora and Nebula\\'s story. He did not know at that time if Howard would appear after doing so in the previous Guardians films. Poulter was cast as Adam Warlock in October, and Gunn said \\\\\"dozens of roles\\\\\" had already been cast. Poulter was chosen for the part because of his dramatic and comedic abilities and because Gunn \\\\\"wanted somebody who was youthful\\\\\" and would fit with Marvel Studios\\' future plans for the character. Casting also took place for various background roles, including aliens and security guards. Pratt began rehearsals and camera tests later that month, and a production meeting was held in early November, shortly before the start of filming. Gunn also reiterated his comments on not resurrecting Yondu in the film.\\\\nTriplets:\\\\n\"], \"model\": \"text-davinci-002\", \"temperature\": 0.0, \"max_tokens\": 256, \"top_p\": 1, \"frequency_penalty\": 0, \"presence_penalty\": 0, \"n\": 1, \"logit_bias\": {}}' message='Post details'\n",

Hermanns also said the second trailer \\\\\"goes a step further in highlighting the emotional story\\\\\" after the first one \\\\\"efficiently set [the film\\'s] tone, featuring plenty of melancholic shots of the [Guardians of the Galaxy] facing the music\\\\\". The trailer accumulated 134.1 million views across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, and was the most-watched Super Bowl trailer in post-game day traffic according to RelishMix. It was also the first time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic that a Super Bowl trailer exceeded 100 million views on social media in a 24-hour period.Disney and Marvel Music partnered with the music streaming service Spotify in May 2023, to promote the film. As part of the promotion, a playlist, titled the \\\\\"K-GOTG Radio Experience\\\\\", was created. Marvel Studios also promoted the film with General Mills limited-edition cereals and snacks, including Honey Nut Cheerios, Cookie Crisp, Lucky Charms, Trix, Reese\\'s Puffs, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and Go-Gurt.\\\\nTriplets:\\\\n\"], \"model\": \"text-davinci-002\", \"temperature\": 0.0, \"max_tokens\": 256, \"top_p\": 1, \"frequency_penalty\": 0, \"presence_penalty\": 0, \"n\": 1, \"logit_bias\": {}}' message='Post details'\n",

Later in September, Gunn said he was unlikely to return for another Guardians film but would continue to work with Marvel Studios on other projects that use the Guardians and cosmic characters. One such project from Gunn was a film centered on Drax and Mantis, which Bautista called \\\\\"brilliant\\\\\". However, in May 2021, Bautista stated that he had not heard any further updates regarding it, feeling Marvel Studios was not \\\\\"very interested, or it doesn\\'t fit into the way they have things mapped out\\\\\". Gunn confirmed in September 2019 that he intended for Vol. 3 to be his last Guardians film, which he reaffirmed in May 2021. In July 2021, Gillan expressed her desire to continue playing Nebula after Vol. 3. In April 2023, Salda\\\\u00f1a confirmed that Vol. 3 would be the last time she portrays Gamora, but hoped Marvel would recast the role with a younger actor because she wished for the character to continue.
