2023-24 .pdf  NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023 -24 Version 1. 0 (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 8 of 101 Introduction   The provision of supports for participants in the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is  subject to regulation by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) and the NDIS Qual ity and  Safeguards Commission  through the provisions of the  National Disability Insurance Scheme Act  2013  and its subordinate  legislation.   This document, which is called the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits , and its associated  documents (see below), set out the pricing arrangements and price limits that the NDIA has  determined will apply to  the provision of supports for participants in the NDIS. The intent of these  documents  is to assist participants and providers, both current and prospective , to understand the  ways in which price controls work in the NDIS. Price regulation is in place to help ensure that  participants receive value for money when they purchase  the supports that they need .  Price regulation documents   NDIS  Pricing Arrangements an d Price Limits    This document sets out the general pricing arrangements that apply to all supports in the NDIS and  the specific arrangements that apply to individual supports.   NDIS Support Catalogue   This document  provides information on the current price limits for each support item and indicates  for each price -limited support item the claim types (Travel, non -face-to-face, etc.) that can be used.  Requirements specified in the Support Catalogue  are part of the pricing arrangements and price  limits that the NDIA has determined should  apply to NDIS.   The NDIA sometimes deactivates support items. Deactivated support items cannot be used.   Before a support is deactivated it is converted into a Legacy Support for a period of time. These  legacy supports are listed in a separate tab of the Support Catalogue  for the information of  providers and participants. Providers and participants should no t create new service bookings for  legacy supports. In general, c laims for legacy supports should only  continue to be made against a  servic e booking  if that service booking was  in existence at the time the support was turned into a  legacy sup port.  Addenda t o the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits   These documents allow the NDIA to respond to changing market conditions in an efficient manner.  They are used to make  temporary changes to some of the support items and arrangements  listed  in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits . Addend a are not stand -alone document s and  must be read in conjunction with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits . Requirements  specified in Addenda are part of the pricing arrangements and price limits that t he NDIA has  determined will apply to NDIS.   NDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation   This document sets out the specific pricing arrangements  that apply for Specialist Disability  Accommodation (SDA). Providers of SDA supports are al so subject to the general arrangements  set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits .\", \"page_label: 9 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  Introduction   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 9 of 101 NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and Consumables Code Guide   This document gives further information on the specific pricing arrangements  that apply for these  types of support. Providers of these supports are also subject to the general arrangements set out  in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits .  Priority  of Interpretation   To the extent of any inconsistency between provisions of the various documents that set out the  pricing arrangements for the NDIS, priority will be accorded in descending order to:   (a) The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits;   (b) The NDIS  Support Catalogue;   (c) Any Addenda to the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits;   (d) The NDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation ; and   (e) The NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and Consumables Code Guide.   These documents are updated from time to time and are published on the NDIS website .  Participants and providers should always refer to the website version of a document  when they are  seeking to understand pricing arrangements  that apply in the NDIS .  Applicabili ty of Price L imits   Supports can be subject to price regulation in different ways:   \\\\u2022 Price controlled supports  should only be claimed by a provider from a participant\\\\u2019s plan  when they are reasonable and necessary to meet a participant\\\\u2019s needs and are subject to  the conditions set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits .  \\\\u2022 Quotable supports  should only be claimed by a provider from a participant\\\\u2019s plan if the  support is specifically included in the participant\\\\u2019s plan. They are subject to the conditions set  out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits .  \\\\u2022 Some supports are not subject to price contr ol. These supports should only be claimed by a  provider from a participant\\\\u2019s plan when they are re asonable and necessary to meet the   participant\\\\u2019s needs. They are subject to the other conditions set out in the NDIS Prici ng  Arrangements and Price Limits .  In most cases , support items subject to price limits have a single national price limit. In some  cases, there are different price limits for different jurisdictions. Higher  price limits can apply in  remote and very remote areas.    The pricing arrangements do not only set the price limits for supports. They also specify when and  how supports can be claimed , including  what has to have happened for a support to be claimable .  Agency Managed Participants   A provider of a support tha t is agency managed in a participant\\\\u2019s plan :  \\\\u2022 Must be a Registered Provider with the NDIS;   \\\\u2022 Must declare relevant prices and conditions to participants before delivering a service,  including any notice periods or cancellation terms; and   \\\\u2022 Must adhere to the arrangements prescribed in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price  Limits , including ensuring that their prices do not exceed the price limits.\", \"page_label: 10 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  Introduction   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 10 of 101 The NDIA does not set the prices that providers charge participants . Each provider  must agree the  price for each support with each particip ant, subject to the price limits and pricing arrangements  that are imposed by the NDIA.   Providers should not indicate in any way to participants that the prices that they charge are  set by the NDIA.   In general,  provider s should not  charge  NDIS participant s more for  a support than they would  charge anyone else for the same support . If the price a provider offer s to a NDIS participant is  different to that which they would offer to a person who was not  an NDIA participant , then the  provider should ensure that the participant is aware of this difference  and the reasons for the  difference .  Providers are required to acknow ledge compliance with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price  Limits  and its associated documents when submitting a payment request through the myplace  Provider Portal.   Plan Managed Participants   Plan managers must adhere to the arrangements prescribed in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements  and Price Limits , including ensuring that the  prices charged by providers do not exceed the price  limits . This rule applies regardless of whether the participant purchase s the support from a  register ed or an unregistered provid er.  Plan managers must  provide the Australian Business Number ( ABN) of the service provider who  delivers the support for all payment requests. The NDIA will only accept payment requests without  an ABN if the service provider is exempt from quoting an ABN under Australian Taxation Office   (ATO) rules.  Exempt providers must complete the A TO\\\\u2019s Statement by a S upplier form. Plan  managers are expected to ke ep a copy of the completed form.   Plan managers must always ensure that a valid tax invoice is included with relev ant information  about the goods/ services purchased for all payment requests. A plan manager may be liable to pay  back any amount not spent in accordance with a participant\\\\u2019s pl an.

Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is  subject to regulation by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) and the NDIS Qual ity and  Safeguards Commission  through the provisions of the  National Disability Insurance Scheme Act  2013  and its subordinate  legislation.   This document, which is called the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits , and its associated  documents (see below), set out the pricing arrangements and price limits that the NDIA has  determined will apply to  the provision of supports for participants in the NDIS. The intent of these  documents  is to assist participants and providers, both current and prospective , to understand the  ways in which price controls work in the NDIS. Price regulation is in place to help ensure that  participants receive value for money when they purchase  the supports that they need .  Price regulation documents   NDIS  Pricing Arrangements an d Price Limits    This document sets out the general pricing arrangements that apply to all supports in the NDIS and  the specific arrangements that apply to individual supports.   NDIS Support Catalogue   This document  provides information on the current price limits for each support item and indicates  for each price -limited support item the claim types (Travel, non -face-to-face, etc.) that can be used.  Requirements specified in the Support Catalogue  are part of the pricing arrangements and price  limits that the NDIA has determined should  apply to NDIS.   The NDIA sometimes deactivates support items. Deactivated support items cannot be used.   Before a support is deactivated it is converted into a Legacy Support for a period of time. These  legacy supports are listed in a separate tab of the Support Catalogue  for the information of  providers and participants. Providers and participants should no t create new service bookings for  legacy supports. In general, c laims for legacy supports should only  continue to be made against a  servic e booking  if that service booking was  in existence at the time the support was turned into a  legacy sup port.  Addenda t o the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits   These documents allow the NDIA to respond to changing market conditions in an efficient manner.  They are used to make  temporary changes to some of the support items and arrangements  listed  in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits . Addend a are not stand -alone document s and  must be read in conjunction with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits . Requirements  specified in Addenda are part of the pricing arrangements and price limits that t he NDIA has  determined will apply to NDIS.   NDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation   This document sets out the specific pricing arrangements  that apply for Specialist Disability  Accommodation (SDA). Providers of SDA supports are al so subject to the general arrangements  set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits .\", \"page_label: 9 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  Introduction   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 9 of 101 NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and Consumables Code Guide   This document gives further information on the specific pricing arrangements  that apply for these  types of support. Providers of these supports are also subject to the general arrangements set out  in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits .  Priority  of Interpretation   To the extent of any inconsistency between provisions of the various documents that set out the  pricing arrangements for the NDIS, priority will be accorded in descending order to:   (a) The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits;   (b) The NDIS  Support Catalogue;   (c) Any Addenda to the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits;   (d) The NDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation ; and   (e) The NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and Consumables Code Guide.   These documents are updated from time to time and are published on the NDIS website .  Participants and providers should always refer to the website version of a document  when they are  seeking to understand pricing arrangements  that apply in the NDIS .  Applicabili ty of Price L imits   Supports can be subject to price regulation in different ways:   \\\\u2022 Price controlled supports  should only be claimed by a provider from a participant\\\\u2019s plan  when they are reasonable and necessary to meet a participant\\\\u2019s needs and are subject to  the conditions set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits .  \\\\u2022 Quotable supports  should only be claimed by a provider from a participant\\\\u2019s plan if the  support is specifically included in the participant\\\\u2019s plan. They are subject to the conditions set  out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits .  \\\\u2022 Some supports are not subject to price contr ol. These supports should only be claimed by a  provider from a participant\\\\u2019s plan when they are re asonable and necessary to meet the   participant\\\\u2019s needs. They are subject to the other conditions set out in the NDIS Prici ng  Arrangements and Price Limits .  In most cases , support items subject to price limits have a single national price limit. In some  cases, there are different price limits for different jurisdictions. Higher  price limits can apply in  remote and very remote areas.    The pricing arrangements do not only set the price limits for supports. They also specify when and  how supports can be claimed , including  what has to have happened for a support to be claimable .  Agency Managed Participants   A provider of a support tha t is agency managed in a participant\\\\u2019s plan :  \\\\u2022 Must be a Registered Provider with the NDIS;   \\\\u2022 Must declare relevant prices and conditions to participants before delivering a service,  including any notice periods or cancellation terms; and   \\\\u2022 Must adhere to the arrangements prescribed in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price  Limits , including ensuring that their prices do not exceed the price limits.\", \"page_label: 10 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  Introduction   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 10 of 101 The NDIA does not set the prices that providers charge participants . Each provider  must agree the  price for each support with each particip ant, subject to the price limits and pricing arrangements  that are imposed by the NDIA.   Providers should not indicate in any way to participants that the prices that they charge are  set by the NDIA.   In general,  provider s should not  charge  NDIS participant s more for  a support than they would  charge anyone else for the same support . If the price a provider offer s to a NDIS participant is  different to that which they would offer to a person who was not  an NDIA participant , then the  provider should ensure that the participant is aware of this difference  and the reasons for the  difference .  Providers are required to acknow ledge compliance with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price  Limits  and its associated documents when submitting a payment request through the myplace  Provider Portal.   Plan Managed Participants   Plan managers must adhere to the arrangements prescribed in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements  and Price Limits , including ensuring that the  prices charged by providers do not exceed the price  limits . This rule applies regardless of whether the participant purchase s the support from a  register ed or an unregistered provid er.  Plan managers must  provide the Australian Business Number ( ABN) of the service provider who  delivers the support for all payment requests. The NDIA will only accept payment requests without  an ABN if the service provider is exempt from quoting an ABN under Australian Taxation Office   (ATO) rules.  Exempt providers must complete the A TO\\\\u2019s Statement by a S upplier form. Plan  managers are expected to ke ep a copy of the completed form.   Plan managers must always ensure that a valid tax invoice is included with relev ant information  about the goods/ services purchased for all payment requests. A plan manager may be liable to pay  back any amount not spent in accordance with a participant\\\\u2019s pl an.  Plan managers are required to acknowledge compliance with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and  Price Limits  and its associated documents when submitting payment requests through the myplace  Provider Portal.   Self-managing Participants   Self-managing partici pants can use registered or unregistered providers and are not subject to the  price limits or other pricing arrangements set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price  Limits  and its associated documents.\"], \"model\": \"text-embedding-ada-002\", \"encoding_format\": \"base64\"}' message='Post details'\n",

These categories can  be relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for  providers when seeking payment for delivered supports.   Support Items   Each support that a provider supplies to a partici pant can be classified as one of the support items  listed in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  and in the NDIS Support Catalogue .  Providers should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they  have delivered.   Each support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:     For example:   01_013_0107_1_1 \\\\u2013 Assistance with Self -Care Activities \\\\u2013 Standard \\\\u2013 Saturday   Support   Category  Sequence   Number  Registration   Group  Outcome   Domain  Support   Purpose   01 013 0107  1 1  Support Purpose s  NDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purpose s:  1.  CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant  budgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support  budgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes ( i.e., capital or  capacity building supports).   2.  CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle  modifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this  support purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant\\\\u2019s plan.   3.  CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and  skills.   Support Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework   Participant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the  goals set out in the participant\\\\u2019s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes  Framework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and  overall per formance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which  help participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners  to explore  where supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are r equired. These  domains are:   1. Daily Living  5. Work   2. Home  6. Social and Community Participation   3. Health and Wellbeing  7.

Choice and Control   NDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must  contribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant\\\\u2019s plan. Support  purpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework  and the 15 s upport  categories .

Where price limits apply  to a support , prices charged to participants must  not exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price  Limits . Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims f or payment that they make  accurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency , volume and type of support.  Claims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.  Falsifying claims for payment is a seri ous compliance issue and may result in action against the  provider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.   Service Agreements   A Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider.  They help to  ensure there is a shared understanding of:   \\\\u2022 Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and   \\\\u2022 The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to  resolve any problems  that may arise.   Service Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered.  They  can include information such as:   \\\\u2022 What supports and services  the provider has agreed to provide;   \\\\u2022 The prices of those supports and services;   \\\\u2022 How, when and where the supports and services are provided;   \\\\u2022 The duration of the Service Agreement  and w hen and how the Agreement will be reviewed;   \\\\u2022 How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;   \\\\u2022 How any problems or issues  that m ay arise will be handled;   \\\\u2022 Participant  responsibilit ies under the Service Agreement; and   \\\\u2022 Provider  responsibilities  under the Service Agreement.   Providers should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that  are not in line wi th those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  and its  associated documents.   Service Bookings   Service bookings are used  to set aside funding in a participant\\\\u2019s plan for a regis tered provider for a  support they will deliver. Service book ings can be made by the participant or provider in the  myplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each  service booking sets out the specific support  items or support category delivered and period of  service delivery within the plan dates. Servic e bookings are not the same as servi ce agreements .  The Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the  category level, where  possible. This allows providers and participants to negoti ate or access supports on a more flexible  basis, especially for on -the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must  have a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal.  Further information  can be found on the NDIS website .\", \"page_label: 15 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 15 of 101 Claiming for support items that are subject to quotation   Providers can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant\\\\u2019s plan if  they provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant\\\\u2019s  plan.  When the NDIA approves a quote, then  it will create  a service booking  for the support item  that the provider can use for claiming purposes.   Claiming for support items that  have a price limit   Where a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with  the participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for  the item and at the agree d unit price , which must not be higher than the applicable price limit .  Example \\\\u2013 Claiming for a support subject to price limit   A provider has agreed to  deliver  a support  to a partici pant at an hourly rate of $5 0.  If the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agree d unit price of  $50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.   Claiming for support items that do not have a price limit   Where a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on  the reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule  for the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These  claims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be  claimed for after they have been delivered.   The provider should claim for that item by reference to the \\\\u201cnotional unit price\\\\u201d that is set out in the  NDIS Support Catalogue  or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and  Consumables Code Guide.   Example \\\\u2013 Claiming for Low Cost AT   A Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.   The relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price  limit but has a \\\\u201cnotional\\\\u201d unit price of $1 .00.   The provider would  submit a payment request for 5 30 units at $1 .00 a unit for a total amount of $530.   Example \\\\u2013 Claiming for Activity Based Transport   The activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a \\\\u201cnotional\\\\u201d unit limit of $1 .00.  If, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $ 21.50  (in this example against  the support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1 .00 a unit  for a total cost of $ 21.50 .  Time of Day and Day of Week    In determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the  support is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as  determined by the applicable Industry Award or En terprise Bargaining Agreement .  For NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the  support was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.  (Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday,  Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\", \"page_label: 16 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 16 of 101 \\\\u2022 A Night -time Sleepover Support  is any support to a participant delivered on a weekday, a  Saturday, a Sunday or a Public Holiday that:   o Commences before midnight on a day and finishes after midnight on that day; and   o Is for a  continuous period of eight (8) hours or more; and   o The worker is allowed to sleep when they are not providing support.   \\\\u2022 A Public Holiday Support  is any support to a participant that starts at or after midnight on  the night prior to a Public Holiday and ends  before or at midnight of that Public Holiday  (unless it is a Night -time Sleepover Support).   \\\\u2022 A Saturday Support  is any support to a participant that starts at or after midnight on the  night prior to a Saturday and ends before or at midnight of that Saturday (unless it is a Public  Holiday or Night -time Sleepover Support).   \\\\u2022 A Sunday Support  is any support to a participant that starts at o r after midnight on the night  prior to a Sunday and ends before or at midnight of that Sunday (unless it is a Public Holiday  or Night -time Sleepover Support).   \\\\u2022 A Weekday Support  is any other support:   o For Disability Support Workers :  \\\\u25aa A Weekday Daytime Support  is any support to a participant that starts at or after  6:00 am and ends before or at 8:00 pm on a single weekday (unless it is a Public  Holiday or Night -time Sleepover Support).   \\\\u25aa A Weekday  Evening Support  is any support to a participant that starts  after 8:00 pm  and finishes at or before midnight on a single weekday (unless it is a Public Holiday or  Night -time Sleepover Support).   \\\\u25aa A Weekday  Night Support  is any support to a participant that commences at or  before midnight on a weekday and finishes af ter midnight on that weekday, or  commences before 6:00 am on a weekday and finishes on that weekday (unless it is a  Public Holiday, Saturday, Sunday or Night -time Sleepover Support).   o For Nurses delivering Nursing Supports:   \\\\u25aa A Weekday Daytime Support  is any support to a participant that commences before  12.00 noon on a Weekday and finishes on the same day (unless it is a Public Holiday,  Weekday Evening, or Weekday Night Support).   \\\\u25aa A Weekday Evening  Support  is any support to a participant that commences not  earlier than 12.00 noon on a Weekday and finishes after 6.00 pm on the same day  (unless it is a Public Holiday Support).   \\\\u25aa A Weekday Night Support  is any support to a participant that commences on or after  6.00 pm on a Weekday and finishes before 7.30 am on the  following day (unless it is a  Public Holiday Support).   If a support to a participant does not meet one of the above criteria then it needs to be billed as two  or more separate supports. An exception to this general rule occurs when a particular support  crosses a shift boundary and the same worker delivers the entire support. In this case, the higher  of the relevant price limits applies to the entire support and the provider should make the claim  against the relevant support item. Providers are required to discuss this billing arrangement with  the participant.\", \"page_label: 17 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 17 of 101 Night -Time Sleepover supports   This support provide s a participant with assistance with, or supervision of, personal tasks of daily  life where overnight support is needed, but the caregiver can sleep when not required to provide  support. This support applies to any day of the w eek and on public holidays. Th is support item  includes up to two hours of active supports provided to the participant for the duration of the period.  Providers may claim for the third or additional hour at Saturday rates on weekdays, or at applicable  rates on other days (Saturday, Sund ay or Public Holidays).   Note, there is no  night -time sleepover support item for nurses .  Claiming for Telehealth Services   Telehealth can be used to deliver direct supports where appropriate and with the agreement of the  participant.   Providers can only claim  Telehealth Services where the following conditions are met:   \\\\u2022 The delivery of the support by telehealth is appropriate; and   \\\\u2022 The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and  Price Limits  and with the Service Agreement wit h the participant; and   \\\\u2022 The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant (rather  than a general activity such as enrolment, administration or staff rostering); and   \\\\u2022 The provider explains the activities to the parti cipant, including why they represent the best  use of the participant\\\\u2019s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the  participant); and   \\\\u2022 The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement   between the participant and provider specifies that Telehealth services can be claimed).   Providers have a duty of care to their participants to ensure they are providing the same standard  of care through video technology as in a clinical setting.   Claims f or Telehealth Services should be made using the relevant support item as indicated in  NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  by using the \\\\u201cTelehealth Services\\\\u201d option in the  myplace portal.   Claiming for Non-direct Services   Non-Face -to-Face Support Prov ision   Providers can only claim from a participant\\\\u2019s plan for the Non -Face -to-Face delivery of a support  item if all of the following conditions are met:   \\\\u2022 The NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  indicates that providers can claim for Non- Face -to-Face Support Provision in respect of that support item; and   \\\\u2022 The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and  Price Limits  and with the Service Agreement with the participant ; and  \\\\u2022 The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant or in  the case of group -based supports, are required to enable the group support to be delivered  (rather than a general activity such as enrolment, administration o r staff rostering); and\", \"page_label: 18 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 18 of 101 \\\\u2022 The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best  use of the participant\\\\u2019s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the  participant); and   \\\\u2022 The provider has th e agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement  between the participant and provider specifies that Non -Face -to-Face supports can be  claimed).   For example, the Assistance with Self Care support items are described as covering acti vities  \\\\u201cAssisting with, and/or supervising, personal tasks of daily life to develop skills of the participant to  live as autonomously as possible\\\\u201d. Therefore, time spent on Non -Face -to-Face activities that assist  the participant \\\\u2013 for example, writing repo rts for co -workers and other providers about the client\\\\u2019s  progress with skill development \\\\u2013 could be claimed against this support item.   The costs of training and up -skilling staff, and of supervision, are included in the base price limits  for supports and  are not considered billable Non -Face -to-Face supports. However, research  undertaken by a capacity -building provider specifically linked to the needs of a participant and to  the achievement of the participant\\\\u2019s goals may be billable as a Non -Face -to-Face s upport with the  participant\\\\u2019s prior agreement.   Service agreements with each client can \\\\u2018pre -authorise \\\\u2019 these activities, but providers should only  claim  a support item from a participant\\\\u2019s plan if they have completed activities that are part of the  support  for that participant. Charging a fee that is not linked to  completed activities is not permitted.   Time spent on administration, such as the processing of NDIS payment claims for all clients,  should not be claimed from a participant\\\\u2019s budget as a Non -Face -to-Face support. The NDIS price  limits include an allowance for overheads, including the costs of administration tasks. Examples of  administrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and  that should not be bill ed as Non -Face -to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:   \\\\u2022 Pre-engagement visits;   \\\\u2022 Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;   \\\\u2022 Entering or amending participant details into system;   \\\\u2022 Making participant service time changes;   \\\\u2022 Staff / participant travel mo nitoring and adjustment;   \\\\u2022 Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;   \\\\u2022 Completing a quoting tool;   \\\\u2022 Making service bookings ; and   \\\\u2022 Making payment claims.   The fee charged for Non -Face -To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant  in the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.   Claims for Non -Face -to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the \\\\u201cNon - Face -to-Face\\\\u201d option in the myplace portal.   Provider Travel   Providers can only claim from a particip ant\\\\u2019s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a  support item if all of the following conditions are met:\", \"page_label: 19 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 19 of 101 \\\\u2022 The NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  indicates that providers can claim for  Provider Travel in respect of that support item; and   \\\\u2022 The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and  Price Limits  and  \\\\u2022 The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and   \\\\u2022 The support is delivered directly (face -to-face) to the  participant; and   \\\\u2022 The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best  use of the participant\\\\u2019s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the  participant); and   \\\\u2022 The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement  between the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);  and  \\\\u2022 The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent  travell ing as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is  a sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or  between participants.   Provider Travel \\\\u2013 Labour Costs (Time)   Where a provid er claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel  time that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is  30 minutes in MMM1 -3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4 -5 areas. (Note th e relevant MMM  classification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)   In addition to the above travel, providers  delivering core and capacity -building supports  are  permitted to claim for provider travel i n respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent  travelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable  when the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel  time that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes  in MMM1 -3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4 -5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the  classification of the area where the partici pant is when the support is delivered.)   Where a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a \\\\u2018region\\\\u2019 , then it is  reasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where  applicable) be tween the participants  who received support from the worker . This apportionment  should be agreed with each participant in advance  as part of the service agreement .  Claims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the prima ry  support (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary  support and the \\\\u201cProvider Travel\\\\u201d option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect  of a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant  for the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the  participant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.   Provider Travel \\\\u2013 Non-Labour Costs   If a provider incurs  costs, in addition to the cost of a worker\\\\u2019s time, when travelling to deliver Face - to-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the  vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reason able contribution  towards these costs.

Claims for the non -labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately  to the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel  time associated with the provider travel.

These categories can  be relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for  providers when seeking payment for delivered supports.   Support Items   Each support that a provider supplies to a partici pant can be classified as one of the support items  listed in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  and in the NDIS Support Catalogue .  Providers should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they  have delivered.   Each support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:     For example:   01_013_0107_1_1 \\\\u2013 Assistance with Self -Care Activities \\\\u2013 Standard \\\\u2013 Saturday   Support   Category  Sequence   Number  Registration   Group  Outcome   Domain  Support   Purpose   01 013 0107  1 1  Support Purpose s  NDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purpose s:  1.  CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant  budgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support  budgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes ( i.e., capital or  capacity building supports).   2.  CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle  modifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this  support purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant\\\\u2019s plan.   3.  CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and  skills.   Support Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework   Participant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the  goals set out in the participant\\\\u2019s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes  Framework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and  overall per formance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which  help participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners  to explore  where supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are r equired. These  domains are:   1. Daily Living  5. Work   2. Home  6. Social and Community Participation   3. Health and Wellbeing  7.

Support  purpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework  and the 15 s upport  categories .

Where price limits apply  to a support , prices charged to participants must  not exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price  Limits . Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims f or payment that they make  accurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency , volume and type of support.  Claims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.  Falsifying claims for payment is a seri ous compliance issue and may result in action against the  provider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.   Service Agreements   A Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider.  They help to  ensure there is a shared understanding of:   \\\\u2022 Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and   \\\\u2022 The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to  resolve any problems  that may arise.   Service Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered.  They  can include information such as:   \\\\u2022 What supports and services  the provider has agreed to provide;   \\\\u2022 The prices of those supports and services;   \\\\u2022 How, when and where the supports and services are provided;   \\\\u2022 The duration of the Service Agreement  and w hen and how the Agreement will be reviewed;   \\\\u2022 How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;   \\\\u2022 How any problems or issues  that m ay arise will be handled;   \\\\u2022 Participant  responsibilit ies under the Service Agreement; and   \\\\u2022 Provider  responsibilities  under the Service Agreement.   Providers should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that  are not in line wi th those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  and its  associated documents.   Service Bookings   Service bookings are used  to set aside funding in a participant\\\\u2019s plan for a regis tered provider for a  support they will deliver. Service book ings can be made by the participant or provider in the  myplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each  service booking sets out the specific support  items or support category delivered and period of  service delivery within the plan dates. Servic e bookings are not the same as servi ce agreements .  The Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the  category level, where  possible. This allows providers and participants to negoti ate or access supports on a more flexible  basis, especially for on -the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must  have a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal.  Further information  can be found on the NDIS website .\", \"page_label: 15 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 15 of 101 Claiming for support items that are subject to quotation   Providers can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant\\\\u2019s plan if  they provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant\\\\u2019s  plan.  When the NDIA approves a quote, then  it will create  a service booking  for the support item  that the provider can use for claiming purposes.   Claiming for support items that  have a price limit   Where a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with  the participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for  the item and at the agree d unit price , which must not be higher than the applicable price limit .  Example \\\\u2013 Claiming for a support subject to price limit   A provider has agreed to  deliver  a support  to a partici pant at an hourly rate of $5 0.  If the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agree d unit price of  $50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.   Claiming for support items that do not have a price limit   Where a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on  the reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule  for the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These  claims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be  claimed for after they have been delivered.   The provider should claim for that item by reference to the \\\\u201cnotional unit price\\\\u201d that is set out in the  NDIS Support Catalogue  or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and  Consumables Code Guide.   Example \\\\u2013 Claiming for Low Cost AT   A Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.   The relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price  limit but has a \\\\u201cnotional\\\\u201d unit price of $1 .00.   The provider would  submit a payment request for 5 30 units at $1 .00 a unit for a total amount of $530.   Example \\\\u2013 Claiming for Activity Based Transport   The activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a \\\\u201cnotional\\\\u201d unit limit of $1 .00.  If, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $ 21.50  (in this example against  the support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1 .00 a unit  for a total cost of $ 21.50 .  Time of Day and Day of Week    In determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the  support is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as  determined by the applicable Industry Award or En terprise Bargaining Agreement .  For NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the  support was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.  (Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday,  Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\", \"page_label: 16 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 16 of 101 \\\\u2022 A Night -time Sleepover Support  is any support to a participant delivered on a weekday, a  Saturday, a Sunday or a Public Holiday that:   o Commences before midnight on a day and finishes after midnight on that day; and   o Is for a  continuous period of eight (8) hours or more; and   o The worker is allowed to sleep when they are not providing support.   \\\\u2022 A Public Holiday Support  is any support to a participant that starts at or after midnight on  the night prior to a Public Holiday and ends  before or at midnight of that Public Holiday  (unless it is a Night -time Sleepover Support).   \\\\u2022 A Saturday Support  is any support to a participant that starts at or after midnight on the  night prior to a Saturday and ends before or at midnight of that Saturday (unless it is a Public  Holiday or Night -time Sleepover Support).   \\\\u2022 A Sunday Support  is any support to a participant that starts at o r after midnight on the night  prior to a Sunday and ends before or at midnight of that Sunday (unless it is a Public Holiday  or Night -time Sleepover Support).   \\\\u2022 A Weekday Support  is any other support:   o For Disability Support Workers :  \\\\u25aa A Weekday Daytime Support  is any support to a participant that starts at or after  6:00 am and ends before or at 8:00 pm on a single weekday (unless it is a Public  Holiday or Night -time Sleepover Support).   \\\\u25aa A Weekday  Evening Support  is any support to a participant that starts  after 8:00 pm  and finishes at or before midnight on a single weekday (unless it is a Public Holiday or  Night -time Sleepover Support).   \\\\u25aa A Weekday  Night Support  is any support to a participant that commences at or  before midnight on a weekday and finishes af ter midnight on that weekday, or  commences before 6:00 am on a weekday and finishes on that weekday (unless it is a  Public Holiday, Saturday, Sunday or Night -time Sleepover Support).   o For Nurses delivering Nursing Supports:   \\\\u25aa A Weekday Daytime Support  is any support to a participant that commences before  12.00 noon on a Weekday and finishes on the same day (unless it is a Public Holiday,  Weekday Evening, or Weekday Night Support).   \\\\u25aa A Weekday Evening  Support  is any support to a participant that commences not  earlier than 12.00 noon on a Weekday and finishes after 6.00 pm on the same day  (unless it is a Public Holiday Support).   \\\\u25aa A Weekday Night Support  is any support to a participant that commences on or after  6.00 pm on a Weekday and finishes before 7.30 am on the  following day (unless it is a  Public Holiday Support).   If a support to a participant does not meet one of the above criteria then it needs to be billed as two  or more separate supports. An exception to this general rule occurs when a particular support  crosses a shift boundary and the same worker delivers the entire support. In this case, the higher  of the relevant price limits applies to the entire support and the provider should make the claim  against the relevant support item. Providers are required to discuss this billing arrangement with  the participant.\", \"page_label: 17 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 17 of 101 Night -Time Sleepover supports   This support provide s a participant with assistance with, or supervision of, personal tasks of daily  life where overnight support is needed, but the caregiver can sleep when not required to provide  support. This support applies to any day of the w eek and on public holidays. Th is support item  includes up to two hours of active supports provided to the participant for the duration of the period.  Providers may claim for the third or additional hour at Saturday rates on weekdays, or at applicable  rates on other days (Saturday, Sund ay or Public Holidays).   Note, there is no  night -time sleepover support item for nurses .  Claiming for Telehealth Services   Telehealth can be used to deliver direct supports where appropriate and with the agreement of the  participant.   Providers can only claim  Telehealth Services where the following conditions are met:   \\\\u2022 The delivery of the support by telehealth is appropriate; and   \\\\u2022 The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and  Price Limits  and with the Service Agreement wit h the participant; and   \\\\u2022 The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant (rather  than a general activity such as enrolment, administration or staff rostering); and   \\\\u2022 The provider explains the activities to the parti cipant, including why they represent the best  use of the participant\\\\u2019s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the  participant); and   \\\\u2022 The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement   between the participant and provider specifies that Telehealth services can be claimed).   Providers have a duty of care to their participants to ensure they are providing the same standard  of care through video technology as in a clinical setting.   Claims f or Telehealth Services should be made using the relevant support item as indicated in  NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  by using the \\\\u201cTelehealth Services\\\\u201d option in the  myplace portal.

For example, the Assistance with Self Care support items are described as covering acti vities  \\\\u201cAssisting with, and/or supervising, personal tasks of daily life to develop skills of the participant to  live as autonomously as possible\\\\u201d. Therefore, time spent on Non -Face -to-Face activities that assist  the participant \\\\u2013 for example, writing repo rts for co -workers and other providers about the client\\\\u2019s  progress with skill development \\\\u2013 could be claimed against this support item.   The costs of training and up -skilling staff, and of supervision, are included in the base price limits  for supports and  are not considered billable Non -Face -to-Face supports. However, research  undertaken by a capacity -building provider specifically linked to the needs of a participant and to  the achievement of the participant\\\\u2019s goals may be billable as a Non -Face -to-Face s upport with the  participant\\\\u2019s prior agreement.   Service agreements with each client can \\\\u2018pre -authorise \\\\u2019 these activities, but providers should only  claim  a support item from a participant\\\\u2019s plan if they have completed activities that are part of the  support  for that participant. Charging a fee that is not linked to  completed activities is not permitted.   Time spent on administration, such as the processing of NDIS payment claims for all clients,  should not be claimed from a participant\\\\u2019s budget as a Non -Face -to-Face support. The NDIS price  limits include an allowance for overheads, including the costs of administration tasks. Examples of  administrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and  that should not be bill ed as Non -Face -to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:   \\\\u2022 Pre-engagement visits;   \\\\u2022 Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;   \\\\u2022 Entering or amending participant details into system;   \\\\u2022 Making participant service time changes;   \\\\u2022 Staff / participant travel mo nitoring and adjustment;   \\\\u2022 Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;   \\\\u2022 Completing a quoting tool;   \\\\u2022 Making service bookings ; and   \\\\u2022 Making payment claims.   The fee charged for Non -Face -To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant  in the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.   Claims for Non -Face -to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the \\\\u201cNon - Face -to-Face\\\\u201d option in the myplace portal.

Provider Travel \\\\u2013 Labour Costs (Time)   Where a provid er claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel  time that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is  30 minutes in MMM1 -3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4 -5 areas. (Note th e relevant MMM  classification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)   In addition to the above travel, providers  delivering core and capacity -building supports  are  permitted to claim for provider travel i n respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent  travelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable  when the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel  time that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes  in MMM1 -3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4 -5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the  classification of the area where the partici pant is when the support is delivered.)   Where a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a \\\\u2018region\\\\u2019 , then it is  reasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where  applicable) be tween the participants  who received support from the worker . This apportionment  should be agreed with each participant in advance  as part of the service agreement .  Claims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the prima ry  support (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary  support and the \\\\u201cProvider Travel\\\\u201d option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect  of a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant  for the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the  participant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.   Provider Travel \\\\u2013 Non-Labour Costs   If a provider incurs  costs, in addition to the cost of a worker\\\\u2019s time, when travelling to deliver Face - to-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the  vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reason able contribution  towards these costs.

Provider Travel (in Remote and Very Remote A reas)   In remote and very remote  areas  (MMM6 and MMM7) , providers delivering core and capacity  building supports  may enter specific arrangements with participants to cover travel costs, up to the  relevant hourly rate for the support item. Providers should assist participants to minimise the travel  costs that they need to pay (for example, by co -ordinating appointmen ts with other participants in  an area, so that travel costs can be shared between participants, or by considering the delivery of  the support by telehealth where appropriate).   Short Notice Cancellations   Where a provider has a Short Notice Cancellation (or no show),  they are able to claim 100% of the  agreed fee associated with the activity from the participant\\\\u2019s plan, subject to the NDIS  Pricing  Arrangements and Price Limits  and the terms of the service agreement with the participant.   A cancellation is a short notice cancellation if the participant:   \\\\u2022 Does not show up for a scheduled support within a reasonable time, or is not present at the  agreed place and within a reasonable  time when the provider is travelling to deliver the  support; or   \\\\u2022 Has given less than seven (7) clear days\\\\u2019 notice for a support .  For supports delivered to a group of participants, if a participant cancels their attendance and if the  provider is unable find  another participant to attend the group session in their place then, if the  other requirements for a short notice cancellation are met, the provider is permitted to bill the  participant who has made the short notice cancellation at the previously agreed r ate that they\", \"page_label: 23 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 23 of 101 would have billed if the participant had attended the group. All other participants in the group  should also be billed as though all participant s had attended the group.   Providers can only claim from a participant\\\\u2019s plan for a Short Notice C ancellation of the delivery of  a support item to the participant if all of the following conditions are met:   \\\\u2022 The NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  indicates that providers can claim for Short  Notice Cancellations in respect of that support item; a nd  \\\\u2022 The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and  Price Limits ; and  \\\\u2022 The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement  between the participant and provider should specify that  Short Notice Cancellations can be  claimed); and   \\\\u2022 The provider was not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and are  required to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.   Claims for a short notice  cancellation should be made using the same support item as would have  been used if the support had been delivered, using the \\\\u201cCancellation\\\\u201d option in the myplace portal.   There is no hard limit on the number of short notice cancellations (or no shows) for which a  provider can claim in respect of a participant. However, providers have a duty of care to their  participants and if a participant has an unusual number of cancellations , then the provider should  seek to understand why they are occurring. The NDIA w ill monitor claims for cancellations and may  contact providers who have a participant with an unusual number of cancellations.   Example \\\\u2013 Short Notice Cancellation   A one -hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.   The participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is  not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that  would have b een spent providing the support.   If the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the  provider can claim for this support. The claim should be made at the agreed rate for the service against the relevant  support item using the drop-down  field \\\\u201cCancellation\\\\u201d.   NDIA Requested Reports   Providers can only claim from a participant\\\\u2019s plan for a NDIA Requested Report if all of the  following conditions are met:   \\\\u2022 The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  indicates that providers can cl aim for NDIA  Requested Reports in respect of that support item  and the proposed charges for  the activities  comply with the  NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits ; and  \\\\u2022 The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance ( i.e., the service agreement  with the participant should specify that NDIA Requested Reports can be claimed); and   \\\\u2022 The report is requested by the NDIA.   A report is considered to have been requested by the NDIA if it is a report that is required at the  commencemen t of a plan that outlines plan objectives and goals, or at plan review that measures  functional outcomes against the originally stipulated goals, or that makes recommendations for  ongoing needs (informal, community, mainstream or funded supports).

Claiming for Activity Based Transport   Activity Based Transport \\\\u2013 Social, Economic and Community Participation Supports   Providers of supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation  Support Category (\\\\u201ccommunity participation supp orts\\\\u201d) can, at the request of a participant,  transport a participant to, or from, or as part of, a community participation support. In these cases,  the provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant\\\\u2019s plan for the  time that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community  participation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non -labour costs associated with  transporting the participant (again, as part of the community participatio n support).   The worker\\\\u2019s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the  total time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent  accompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more  participants on the same trip, the worker\\\\u2019s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This  claim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the  participant\\\\u2019s core budget.   If a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker\\\\u2019s time, when accompanying and/or  transporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs  of the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution  towards these costs. The following is a guide as to what  these contributions  might be :  \\\\u2022 For a vehicle that is not  modified for accessibility , up to $0.97  a kilometre ;  \\\\u2022 For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus , up to $2. 76 a kilometre ;  \\\\u2022 For o ther forms o f transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public  transport fares , up to the full amount .  Support items   These non -labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity -based  transport support  item. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants  subject to the rules set out in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements  and Price Limits . Where a provider is  transporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be  apportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.

The transport by a non -disability modified vehicle takes 25 minutes to arrive at the swimming pool, including the time  to assist the participant to and from the vehicle and getting them set up to participate i n the activity. The support  worker accompanies the participant in the vehicle. They then provide 40 minutes of support to the participant at the  pool. Afterwards, they spend 20 minutes returning the participant to their home by the same vehicle. The pool i s  10 kilometres from the participant\\\\u2019s home.   The provider and participant have agreed an hourly rate of $50.00, which is below the price limit for this item. This  amount also applies to the support worker\\\\u2019s time when transporting participants.   The provider and participant have also agreed for the provider to claim for the activity -based  transport costs, which in  this case they have agreed are the support worker\\\\u2019s car park fee ($4.50) and vehicle running costs at a rate as agreed  with the partici pant of $0.85 a kilometre (2x10 km) against support line item   The provider\\\\u2019s claim for the support will be claimed in the Portal as:   \\\\u2022 $70.83 for the 40 minutes of direct support at the swimming pool and 45 minutes transport time against  support item 04_104 _0125_6_1;   \\\\u2022 $21.50 for the non -labour costs of the activity -based  transport against the support item 04_590_0125_6_1.   Note: The provider may also be able to make a claim for the time taken by the worker to travel to the participant  before the support commen ces (see the discussion of Provider Travel above).   Regional, Remote and Very Remote Areas   Different pricing arrangements can apply depending on whether a support is delivered in a regional  remote or very remote area.   Modified Monash Model   To determine wh ether a support is being delivered in a regional remote or very remote area the   NDIA  uses a modification of the Modified Monash Model (MMM). From the 24 October 2020,  the  2019 version of the MMM will be used by the NDIS.   The MMM determine s regional, remote and very remote areas using a scale based on population  size and locality (see Table below).

There is no additional loading applied for supports in Metropolitan areas, Regional Centres or  Regional Areas. However, some different pricing arrangements do appl y in Regional Areas  (MMM4 -5) as set out in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits .  When a support is provided directly to a participant, and the worker delivering the support is at the  same location as the participant, the price limit that applies to the  support is determined by the  location of the participant at the time of service delivery. For example, if a participant living in a  Remote  location visits a provider to receive a service, the support is subject to the price limit that  applies to that location \\\\u2013 not the Remote price limit.   When a support is provided directly to a participant via telehealth , the price limit that applies to the   support should, in general, be the price limit that would apply if the participant was receiving the  support at the place that the person who is delivering the support is located at the time of service  delivery. However, participants in Remote or Very Rem ote areas can agree that those price limits  should apply to the support if they are satisfied that the support provides value for money.   When  a support is not pr ovided directly (for example, Non-Face -to-Face Support Prov ision  or  NDIA Requested Reports ) then the price limit that applies to the support is  the price limit that  would apply if the participant was receiving the support at the place that the person who is  delivering the support is located  at the time of service delivery .  Claiming for Group -Based  Supports   When a support item is delivered to more than one participant at the same time (a group of  participants) then , unless the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  states otherwise,  the  price limit for each participant is the applicable price limit set out in the relevant suppo rt table  divided by the number of participants in the group. Providers should make a claim for each  participant using the relevant support item. Each claim should be for the total time of the support  but is subject to the lower price limit as set out above .  Providers can only claim for supports that are related to the reasonable and necessary needs of a  participant. Where a participant attends a group -based  session then a provider should only claim  for the time of more than one worker  against that participa nt\\\\u2019s plan  if all those workers were  involved in the direct support of the participant for the time claimed.   There are transitional arrangements in place for group -based  supports in the Assistance with  Social, Economic and Community Participation  Support Ca tegory, see page 62.\", \"page_label: 29 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 29 of 101 Programs of Support   A provider of group -based supports in  any of the following categories can enter into an agreement  with a participant for a \\\\u201cprogram of support\\\\u201d, especially where the program is towards the  achievement of a specified outcome :   \\\\u2022 Any support in the Assistance in Shared Living Arrangements \\\\u2013 Suppo rted Independent  Living section of the Assistance with Daily Life  Support Category;   \\\\u2022 Any support in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation  Support  Category, i ncluding Supports in Employment; and   \\\\u2022 Any support in any Capac ity Building Support Category.   Under this approach, providers claim against the plans of all the participants who had agreed to  attend an instance of support in the program of support as though they had attended (whether or  not they  did) \\\\u2013 as long as the provider had the capacity to deliver the support.  Supports delivered  as part of a program of supports are not subject to the short notice cancellation rules.   Note: Providers in Registration Group 0118 (Early Intervention Supports for Early Childhood) can  include 1:1 supports in a program of support but only where these are provided in combination with  group supports.   Programs of support must be  no longer than six months (unless specifically allowed for in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits ; where a Program of Support is longer than 12 weeks,  providers must ensure that participants have an opportunity to regularly review their program of  support. Participants must be able to exit from a program of supports withou t cost, subject to a  notice period of no more than two (2) weeks. Providers and participants can agree to a new  Program of Support at any time.   Where a participant stops attending an agreed program of support but does not provide a notice, a  provider may only continue claiming for a total of four (4) consecutive weeks from when the  participant stopped attending. This is considered an unplanned exit. A provider is not able to  continue to claim past four ( 4) consecutive  week s of non -attendance, unless the participant notifies  the provider during that period that they wish to continue in the Program of Support.   Providers who offer programs of support must enter into an agreement with each  participant  specify ing the program of support, including its length, exit rules and intended outcomes. These  agreements must be consistent with the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits . In particular,  providers cannot pre -claim for programs of support. Each instance of  support in the program of  support has to be delivered before the provider can claim for that instance of support.   Claiming for Centre Based Social , Economic  and Community  Participation Supports   A provider in one of the following Registration Groups can claim an additional amount for the costs  of running and maintaining a facility (Centre) through the relevant Centre Capital Cost support item  when a support item  (\\\\u201cthe primary support\\\\u201d)  in the Assistance with Social , Economic  and  Community Participation Support Category is delivered in  the facility :  \\\\u2022 High Intensity Daily Personal Activities (0104);   \\\\u2022 Specialised Supported Employment (0133); and   \\\\u2022 Group and Centre Based Activities (0136) .\", \"page_label: 30 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 30 of 101 If the primary s upport is being delivered to a group  of participants , then the provider can claim up  to price limit  of the relevant Centre Capital Cost support item in respect of each of the participants   for each hour  of the support .  When a support is delivered partially in a Centre and partially in the Community, and the Centre is  available at all time during the support if required, then providers can claim up to the price limit for  the relevant Centre Capital Cost support item for the entire period of the support.   Note : These arrangements do not apply to providers who choose to use the transitional  arrangements for group -based  supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community  Participation  Support Category, see page 62. The transitional price limits for these supports have  the capital allowance built into them.   Centre Capital Costs   The Centre Capital Cost support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the  rules set out in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits .

They are  also entitled to claim for the time spent travelling back to their usual place of business by applying the 30 -minute time - cap against the 25 minutes of return travel. In total , 55 minutes of travel can be claimed.   Because the worker uses his or her own car to drive to the participant, the provider has agreed to pay the worker  $0.78 per kilometre travelled. T he provider is  entitled to claim for the non -labour costs associated wi th this travel  under the Service Agreement between the provider and the participant indicates that the provider can seek  reimbursement for this cost from the participant\\\\u2019s plan. Because the travel time for both the journey to and from the  participant are c laimable in this case, the non -labour costs associated with both periods of travel can also be claimed  under the Service Agreement.   The provider\\\\u2019s claim for these supports is in three parts, which should be shown separately on their invoice to the  particip ant and claimed for separately.   \\\\u2022 $380.00 for the two hours of support against support item 15_056_0128_1_3   \\\\u2022 $174.17 for the 55 minutes travel to the participant against support item 15_056_0128_1_3 using the drop- down  field \\\\u201cProvider Travel\\\\u201d; and   \\\\u2022 $62.40 for the 80 kilometres travel to and from the participant against support item 15_799_0128_1_3.   Provider Travel (in Remote and Very Remote A reas)   In remote and very remote  areas  (MMM6 and MMM7) , providers delivering core and capacity  building supports  may enter specific arrangements with participants to cover travel costs, up to the  relevant hourly rate for the support item. Providers should assist participants to minimise the travel  costs that they need to pay (for example, by co -ordinating appointmen ts with other participants in  an area, so that travel costs can be shared between participants, or by considering the delivery of  the support by telehealth where appropriate).   Short Notice Cancellations   Where a provider has a Short Notice Cancellation (or no show),  they are able to claim 100% of the  agreed fee associated with the activity from the participant\\\\u2019s plan, subject to the NDIS  Pricing  Arrangements and Price Limits  and the terms of the service agreement with the participant.   A cancellation is a short notice cancellation if the participant:   \\\\u2022 Does not show up for a scheduled support within a reasonable time, or is not present at the  agreed place and within a reasonable  time when the provider is travelling to deliver the  support; or   \\\\u2022 Has given less than seven (7) clear days\\\\u2019 notice for a support .  For supports delivered to a group of participants, if a participant cancels their attendance and if the  provider is unable find  another participant to attend the group session in their place then, if the  other requirements for a short notice cancellation are met, the provider is permitted to bill the  participant who has made the short notice cancellation at the previously agreed r ate that they\", \"page_label: 23 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 23 of 101 would have billed if the participant had attended the group. All other participants in the group  should also be billed as though all participant s had attended the group.   Providers can only claim from a participant\\\\u2019s plan for a Short Notice C ancellation of the delivery of  a support item to the participant if all of the following conditions are met:   \\\\u2022 The NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  indicates that providers can claim for Short  Notice Cancellations in respect of that support item; a nd  \\\\u2022 The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and  Price Limits ; and  \\\\u2022 The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement  between the participant and provider should specify that  Short Notice Cancellations can be  claimed); and   \\\\u2022 The provider was not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and are  required to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.   Claims for a short notice  cancellation should be made using the same support item as would have  been used if the support had been delivered, using the \\\\u201cCancellation\\\\u201d option in the myplace portal.   There is no hard limit on the number of short notice cancellations (or no shows) for which a  provider can claim in respect of a participant. However, providers have a duty of care to their  participants and if a participant has an unusual number of cancellations , then the provider should  seek to understand why they are occurring. The NDIA w ill monitor claims for cancellations and may  contact providers who have a participant with an unusual number of cancellations.   Example \\\\u2013 Short Notice Cancellation   A one -hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.   The participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is  not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that  would have b een spent providing the support.   If the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the  provider can claim for this support. The claim should be made at the agreed rate for the service against the relevant  support item using the drop-down  field \\\\u201cCancellation\\\\u201d.   NDIA Requested Reports   Providers can only claim from a participant\\\\u2019s plan for a NDIA Requested Report if all of the  following conditions are met:   \\\\u2022 The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  indicates that providers can cl aim for NDIA  Requested Reports in respect of that support item  and the proposed charges for  the activities  comply with the  NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits ; and  \\\\u2022 The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance ( i.e., the service agreement  with the participant should specify that NDIA Requested Reports can be claimed); and   \\\\u2022 The report is requested by the NDIA.   A report is considered to have been requested by the NDIA if it is a report that is required at the  commencemen t of a plan that outlines plan objectives and goals, or at plan review that measures  functional outcomes against the originally stipulated goals, or that makes recommendations for  ongoing needs (informal, community, mainstream or funded supports). Provider s may also claim  for other NDIA -requested therapy report that is stipulated as being required in a participant\\\\u2019s plan.\", \"page_label: 24 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 24 of 101 Claims for NDIS requested reports should be made using the relevant support item, using the  \\\\u201cNDIA Report\\\\u201d option in the myplace portal.   Claiming for Activity Based Transport   Activity Based Transport \\\\u2013 Social, Economic and Community Participation Supports   Providers of supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation  Support Category (\\\\u201ccommunity participation supp orts\\\\u201d) can, at the request of a participant,  transport a participant to, or from, or as part of, a community participation support. In these cases,  the provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant\\\\u2019s plan for the  time that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community  participation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non -labour costs associated with  transporting the participant (again, as part of the community participatio n support).   The worker\\\\u2019s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the  total time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent  accompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more  participants on the same trip, the worker\\\\u2019s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This  claim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the  participant\\\\u2019s core budget.   If a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker\\\\u2019s time, when accompanying and/or  transporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs  of the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution  towards these costs. The following is a guide as to what  these contributions  might be :  \\\\u2022 For a vehicle that is not  modified for accessibility , up to $0.97  a kilometre ;  \\\\u2022 For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus , up to $2. 76 a kilometre ;  \\\\u2022 For o ther forms o f transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public  transport fares , up to the full amount .  Support items   These non -labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity -based  transport support  item. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants  subject to the rules set out in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements  and Price Limits . Where a provider is  transporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be  apportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.

The transport by a non -disability modified vehicle takes 25 minutes to arrive at the swimming pool, including the time  to assist the participant to and from the vehicle and getting them set up to participate i n the activity. The support  worker accompanies the participant in the vehicle. They then provide 40 minutes of support to the participant at the  pool. Afterwards, they spend 20 minutes returning the participant to their home by the same vehicle. The pool i s  10 kilometres from the participant\\\\u2019s home.   The provider and participant have agreed an hourly rate of $50.00, which is below the price limit for this item. This  amount also applies to the support worker\\\\u2019s time when transporting participants.

Note: The provider may also be able to make a claim for the time taken by the worker to travel to the participant  before the support commen ces (see the discussion of Provider Travel above).   Regional, Remote and Very Remote Areas   Different pricing arrangements can apply depending on whether a support is delivered in a regional  remote or very remote area.   Modified Monash Model   To determine wh ether a support is being delivered in a regional remote or very remote area the   NDIA  uses a modification of the Modified Monash Model (MMM). From the 24 October 2020,  the  2019 version of the MMM will be used by the NDIS.

There is no additional loading applied for supports in Metropolitan areas, Regional Centres or  Regional Areas. However, some different pricing arrangements do appl y in Regional Areas  (MMM4 -5) as set out in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits .  When a support is provided directly to a participant, and the worker delivering the support is at the  same location as the participant, the price limit that applies to the  support is determined by the  location of the participant at the time of service delivery. For example, if a participant living in a  Remote  location visits a provider to receive a service, the support is subject to the price limit that  applies to that location \\\\u2013 not the Remote price limit.   When a support is provided directly to a participant via telehealth , the price limit that applies to the   support should, in general, be the price limit that would apply if the participant was receiving the  support at the place that the person who is delivering the support is located at the time of service  delivery. However, participants in Remote or Very Rem ote areas can agree that those price limits  should apply to the support if they are satisfied that the support provides value for money.   When  a support is not pr ovided directly (for example, Non-Face -to-Face Support Prov ision  or  NDIA Requested Reports ) then the price limit that applies to the support is  the price limit that  would apply if the participant was receiving the support at the place that the person who is  delivering the support is located  at the time of service delivery .  Claiming for Group -Based  Supports   When a support item is delivered to more than one participant at the same time (a group of  participants) then , unless the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  states otherwise,  the  price limit for each participant is the applicable price limit set out in the relevant suppo rt table  divided by the number of participants in the group. Providers should make a claim for each  participant using the relevant support item. Each claim should be for the total time of the support  but is subject to the lower price limit as set out above .  Providers can only claim for supports that are related to the reasonable and necessary needs of a  participant. Where a participant attends a group -based  session then a provider should only claim  for the time of more than one worker  against that participa nt\\\\u2019s plan  if all those workers were  involved in the direct support of the participant for the time claimed.   There are transitional arrangements in place for group -based  supports in the Assistance with  Social, Economic and Community Participation  Support Ca tegory, see page 62.\", \"page_label: 29 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 29 of 101 Programs of Support   A provider of group -based supports in  any of the following categories can enter into an agreement  with a participant for a \\\\u201cprogram of support\\\\u201d, especially where the program is towards the  achievement of a specified outcome :   \\\\u2022 Any support in the Assistance in Shared Living Arrangements \\\\u2013 Suppo rted Independent  Living section of the Assistance with Daily Life  Support Category;   \\\\u2022 Any support in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation  Support  Category, i ncluding Supports in Employment; and   \\\\u2022 Any support in any Capac ity Building Support Category.   Under this approach, providers claim against the plans of all the participants who had agreed to  attend an instance of support in the program of support as though they had attended (whether or  not they  did) \\\\u2013 as long as the provider had the capacity to deliver the support.  Supports delivered  as part of a program of supports are not subject to the short notice cancellation rules.   Note: Providers in Registration Group 0118 (Early Intervention Supports for Early Childhood) can  include 1:1 supports in a program of support but only where these are provided in combination with  group supports.   Programs of support must be  no longer than six months (unless specifically allowed for in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits ; where a Program of Support is longer than 12 weeks,  providers must ensure that participants have an opportunity to regularly review their program of  support. Participants must be able to exit from a program of supports withou t cost, subject to a  notice period of no more than two (2) weeks. Providers and participants can agree to a new  Program of Support at any time.   Where a participant stops attending an agreed program of support but does not provide a notice, a  provider may only continue claiming for a total of four (4) consecutive weeks from when the  participant stopped attending. This is considered an unplanned exit. A provider is not able to  continue to claim past four ( 4) consecutive  week s of non -attendance, unless the participant notifies  the provider during that period that they wish to continue in the Program of Support.   Providers who offer programs of support must enter into an agreement with each  participant  specify ing the program of support, including its length, exit rules and intended outcomes. These  agreements must be consistent with the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits . In particular,  providers cannot pre -claim for programs of support. Each instance of  support in the program of  support has to be delivered before the provider can claim for that instance of support.   Claiming for Centre Based Social , Economic  and Community  Participation Supports   A provider in one of the following Registration Groups can claim an additional amount for the costs  of running and maintaining a facility (Centre) through the relevant Centre Capital Cost support item  when a support item  (\\\\u201cthe primary support\\\\u201d)  in the Assistance with Social , Economic  and  Community Participation Support Category is delivered in  the facility :  \\\\u2022 High Intensity Daily Personal Activities (0104);   \\\\u2022 Specialised Supported Employment (0133); and   \\\\u2022 Group and Centre Based Activities (0136) .\", \"page_label: 30 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 30 of 101 If the primary s upport is being delivered to a group  of participants , then the provider can claim up  to price limit  of the relevant Centre Capital Cost support item in respect of each of the participants   for each hour  of the support .  When a support is delivered partially in a Centre and partially in the Community, and the Centre is  available at all time during the support if required, then providers can claim up to the price limit for  the relevant Centre Capital Cost support item for the entire period of the support.   Note : These arrangements do not apply to providers who choose to use the transitional  arrangements for group -based  supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community  Participation  Support Category, see page 62. The transitional price limits for these supports have  the capital allowance built into them.

Examples of situations where Irregular SIL Supports would be required  include a participant falling ill or the cancellation of a day program, so that participants are in their  home and require SIL supports for a period that was not initially planned and rostered for.   Claims for Irregular SIL supports are made using the relevant support item, usin g the \\\\u201cIrregular SIL  Support\\\\u201d option in the myplace portal.   SIL Providers are only permitted to claim from a participant\\\\u2019s plan for Irregular SIL Supports if all of  the following conditions are met:   \\\\u2022 The NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  indicates that providers can claim for  Irregular SIL Supports in r espect of that support item;   \\\\u2022 The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and  Price Limits ;  \\\\u2022 Where the SIL activity  does not sit within the definition of a Regular SIL Supports;   \\\\u2022 The provider works with the participant and/or their nominee to explain why Irregular SIL  Supports are required, and the other options available; and   \\\\u2022 The provider has agreement from the partici pant and/or their nominee to claim for the  support before a payment request is made (i.e. , the service agreement between the  participant and the provider should specify that Irregular SIL Supports can be claimed when  required) .  In contrast, Regular SIL sup ports (claimed as Direct Services) are considered as those planned for  as part of a usual week in the SIL plan budget, via  an agreement with the participant and provider  based on the levels of care that can be provided within the approved SIL budget .  The S IL Operational Guideline provides more detail about the types of services that are included  and excluded from the provision of SIL supports.\", \"page_label: 32 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 32 of 101 Claiming for more than one worker or therapist   Sometimes a participant requires assistance from more than one worke r or therapist at the same  time. In these cases, the provider is entitled to bill for the time spent providing the support by all  workers and therapists involved in delivering the support. Examples of cases where this may occur  include:   \\\\u2022 Shadow shifts  that allow new workers to be introduced to a participant who has complex  individual support needs so that they can understand their support needs and patterns;   \\\\u2022 Supervision of, or specific training for, therapy assistants by the supervising therapist as part  of the handover of the support delivery to the participant by the therapist to the therapy  assistant;   \\\\u2022 Case conferences between therapists about the specific s upport needs of a participant.   Shadow Shifts   Shadow shifts may be claimed where the participant has complex individual support needs that are  best met by introducing a new worker to the participant before it is reasonable that they commence  providing the s upport independently \\\\u2013 for example, where the specific individual support needs  include very limited communication; behaviour support needs; and/or medical needs/procedures  such as ventilation or Home Enteral Nutrition (HEN).   Where the individual would require shadow shifts to assist with the introduction of new workers,  and this is the desired method by the participant or their family, the provider may claim for up to 6  hours of weekday support per year.   Supervision / Specific Training for Therapy Assistants   Level 1 Therapy Assistants can only deliver support under the direct supervision of a therapist.  Level 2 Therapy Assistants can deliver supports under indirect supervision but may require specific  training in the needs of the partici pant from the therapist before they take responsibility for the  delivery of the therapy.   In these cases, it is appropriate for the provider to bill for the time spent by both the therapist and  the therapy assistant. This arrangement can represent value for  money for the participant  compared to the alternative of all support s being delivered by the supervising therapists.   Case Conferences for Therapists   Therapists, especially in rural and remote areas, may benefit from a case conference with other  therapists  about the specific care needs of a participant. In these cases, it is appropriate for the  provider to bill for the time spent by all therapists on the case conference.   Other Considerations   Supports must be Reasonable and Necessary   The NDIS provides fundin g to participants for supports and services aimed at increasing their  independence, inclusion, and social and economic participation.   Supports funded by the NDIS need to:   \\\\u2022 Be related to the participant \\\\u2019s disability;\", \"page_label: 33 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 33 of 101 \\\\u2022 Not include day -to-day living costs that are not related to a participant \\\\u2019s disability support  needs;   \\\\u2022 Represent value for money; and   \\\\u2022 Be likely to be effective and beneficial to the participant.   Providers should not claim for supports from a participant\\\\u2019s plan where the support is not in line  with the participant\\\\u2019s goals, objectives and aspirations as set out in their plan or where the support  is not reasonable and necessary. Providers should also not claim for supports from a participant\\\\u2019s  plan where the support is more appropriately funded or pro vided through other service systems.  Further information on when a support is considered reasonable and necessary can be found on  the NDIS w ebsite .  Medicare and Insurance   Some elements of a participant\\\\u2019s care may be covered by funds outside the NDIS. These  expenses are commonly medical, including those  covered by private health insurance or Medicare.  These medical expenses are not funded under the NDIS, even if they are related to, or a symptom  of, the disability. These expenses should be claimed under the relevant health care scheme or  insurance policy. Some providers (e.g. , therapists) may need to di stinguish between the health  services and disability supports that they provide to a single client, and make separate payment  claims to, for example,  Medicare and the NDIS.   Expenses Related to Recreational Pursuits   Providers should not claim payment from participant\\\\u2019s plans for:   \\\\u2022 Expenses related to recreational pursuits, such as event tickets for the participant, as they  are not covered by the NDIS; or   \\\\u2022 The cost of entry for a paid support worker to attend a social or recreational event.   Prepayments   In general, Registered Providers can only make a claim for payment once a service booking has  been created and the support has been delivered or provided.   For higher cost supports, the cost of the support may be claimed  in stages in some circu mstances,  and before the support is finally delivered to the participant.   Prepayments represent funds paid in advance of the provider delivering the agreed support to the  participant. Sometimes providers require prepayment(s) as collateral and/or to cover  their  expenses in order to source, build or tailor the support to meet the participant\\\\u2019s unique need s.   In general,  prepayments should only be sought where a business will incur unrecoverable costs  should delivery of the support to the requesting particip ant not proceed (e.g. , a custo m-made  support).   Prepayments are subject to all of the following conditions:   \\\\u2022 The support item is an assistive technology (including vehicle modification), or a home  modification ;  \\\\u2022 The support item value exceeds $1,500 or is custom made to address the participant\\\\u2019s  disability related requirements, and a valid quote has been provided and accepted by the  participant (or their nominee) ;\", \"page_label: 34 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 34 of 101 \\\\u2022 a service agreement between the provider and participant (or nominee) outlines the  requirement  of a prepayment (e.g. , deposit) or milestone payments, in line with normal  business practice ; and   \\\\u2022 The final payment of not less than 10% of the total cost , may not be claimed until the  participant has received the support ready for use.   A participant is entitled to a refund of any balance of prepayment(s) less the actual unrecoverable  expense incurred by the business to that point when supply is termina ted. The participant remains  fully entitled to their rights under Australian Consumer Law in all circums tances.   Prepayments can be claimed by providers for a support where that support is specifically identified  as eligible for prepayments  in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits . Other supports  may be eligible for prepayment where the NDIA has give n prior written approval (including  conditions) to the registered pro vider to claim for prepayments.   Subscription services   In some cases, a  provider may claim for a service agreed with a participant using a subscription  model of payment. In these cases, t he participant is paying to be able to use that service (on the  terms/hours agreed) for the period of the subscription. Subscriptions may only be used for the  supply of the following supports: Consumables  (Support Category 03) and Assistive  Technology  (Supp ort Category 05).   Providers wanting to claim for a subscription -based  service must make sure that:   \\\\u2022 A plain English service agreement has been accepted by the participant, that makes clear to  the participant the service and its costs (including any extra fe es), as well as reasonable exit  conditions   \\\\u2022 The maximum price limit for a subscription is $5,000 per annum.   \\\\u2022 Subscriptions are  to be  charged monthly (paid at or before the start of the service period) .  Small subscriptions, where the annual cost is not more than $1,500, may be charged less  frequently (quarterly or annually) . For example,  if a subscription service cost $199 per year, it  could be charged for just once per year.   \\\\u2022 There are no penalties (for example exit fees) should a participant wish to can cel a  subscription (with reasonable  one mont h\\\\u2019s notice) on or prior to the end of the paid  subscription period.   \\\\u2022 Invoices for the subscription to be paid, clearly describe the supports for the participant to be  delivered/available during the subscription pe riod. For monthly subscriptions, participants   may agree in writing to be billed quarterly (in advance of the quarter), but must be refunded  any unused months if they cancel the subscription with due notice (as stated above).   High value subscription claimin g applies where the bundle of available Assistive Technology  Products that a participant can access at any time is more than $15,000.   Under high value AT, all the conditions of the subscription services apply, with exception to the  maximum price limit, which is set to $10,000 per annum.   Additional payments are permitted for high value AT subscriptions as follows:   a) freight and in -home technical setup costs may be claimed at the commencement of the  subscription;\", \"page_label: 35 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 35 of 101 b) removal, and return to provider\\\\u2019s agen t nearest to the participant\\\\u2019s residence, of the  supplied AT at the end of the subscription (which may coincide with the death of the  participant); and   c) each such claim under a) or b) shall not exceed one (1) month\\\\u2019s subscription fee or $600,  whichever is l ess.  Co-payments for Capital items, including Assistive T echnology   In general, providers are not permitted to request a c o-payment  by the  participant for a support .  However, where a participant would like a customisation to a support or assistive technology that is  not considered reasonable or necessary, they are required to pay for these  themselves. These  may include an aesthetic customisation to an assistive technology or modificat ions to a vehicle that  are additional to the assistive components.   Other Fees and Charges   All registered providers must not add any other charge to the cost of the supports they provide to  any participant, such as credit card surcharges, or any additional fees including any \\\\u2018gap\\\\u2019 fees, late  payment fees or cancellation fees, unless otherwise permitted by the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements  and Price Limits . Participants are generally not required to pay exit fees, even when changing  provider\\\\u2019s  part way through a plan. A core principle of the NDIS is choice and control for  participants, allowing them to ch ange providers without expense.   Goods and Services Tax (GST)   Many, but not all, NDIA supports provided to NDIS participants are GST -free. Further information  abou t the NDIS and GST can be accessed on the Australian Taxation Office website . Providers  should seek independent legal or fina ncial advice if they require assistance with tax law  compliance. If GST is applicable to a support,  the price limit is inclusive of GST.\", \"page_label: 36 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023 -24 Version 1. 0 (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 36 of 101 Special NDIS Pricing Arrangements   High Intensity Supports   A support is considered a High Intensity support if it is a support provided to a participant:   \\\\u2022 For whom frequent (at least 1 instance per shift) assistance is required to manage  challenging behaviours that require intensive positive behaviour support; and/or   \\\\u2022 Who requires assistance fro m a disability support worker who has one or more of the high  intensity support skills specified in the NDIS Commission \\\\u2019s NDIS Practice Standards: skills  descriptors , which can be downloaded  here .  Temporary Transformation Payment (TTP)   A number of supports in the Assistance with Daily Living Support Category and the Social ,  Economic  and Community Participation Support Category are in the scope of the Temporary  Transformation Payment (TTP). These supports have two support items , in line with the following  example .   01_011_0107_1_1  Assistance Wi th Self -Care Activities \\\\u2013 Standard \\\\u2013 Weekday Daytime   01_011_0107_1_1_T  Assistance With Self -Care Activities \\\\u2013 Standard \\\\u2013 Weekday Daytime \\\\u2013 TTP  The price limit for each TTP item is higher than the price limit for the non -TTP item. The difference  in price limits will be  1.5% of the standard price from 1 July  2023.  As with all supports, providers must also agree the price that they will charge for a support with the  participant. The price for a support cannot be greater than the relevant price limit.   The TTP items can only be used by providers who are compliant with the TTP conditions (see  below). Providers who meet these eligibility criteria are known as TTP providers .  All providers who claim for the TTP in 2023 -24 must:   \\\\u2022 Publish their service prices p rominently on their website, and make them available to  particip ants, including participants who are not their clients, and the NDIA on request; and   \\\\u2022 List their business contact details in the Provider Finder in the myplace portal  and ensure  that those deta ils are kept up -to-date.  In addition, providers who made a claim for the TTP in 2022 -23 can only claim for the TTP in 2023 - 24 if they also took part in the Financial Benchmarking Survey that was carried out for the NDIA in  2021 -22.  All providers who claim for a TTP support item are also required  to acknowledge their compliance  with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits , including the TTP requirements, when  submitting a payment request through the myplace Provider Portal.   Providers are reminded that Section 182 of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013   provides that if a NDIS amount is paid to a person who is not entitled for any reason to the  payment of the NDIS amount then the amount of the payment is a debt due to the Agency.   Plan Managers and the TTP   Plan managers are not  responsible for ensuring pr oviders are TTP compliant. They can accept the  claim for a TTP support item by a registered provider as proof of TTP compliance. Plan managers\", \"page_label: 37 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  Special NDIS Pr icing Arrangements   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 37 of 101 are however required to inform the NDIA, when requested, which registered providers have made  a claim for a TTP s upport item through the plan manager. N on-registered providers are not eligible  for the TTP and plan managers should not use TTP line items to claim for services delivered by  non-registered providers.   Disability -Related Health Supports   The NDIS will fund d isability -related health supports where these supports directly relate to a  participant\\\\u2019s significant and permanent functional impairment and assist them to undertake  activities of daily living. These supports are provided individually to participants and can be  provided in a range of environments, including, but not limited to, the participant\\\\u2019s own home.   Participants are not permitted to claim for health supports from their plans when those health  supports do not relate to their disability and when they d o not require health supports on a regular  basis. Those health supports will continue to be provided by the health system. Additionally, if a  participant\\\\u2019s support needs become acute, that support should be provided in a hospital or another  health setting by the relevant state/territory health care system or private health system and not be  claimed from the participant\\\\u2019s plan.   The list below provides an indication of the majority of disability -related health supports that may  be required by NDIS participan ts; however, it is not an exhaustive list. Disability -related health  supports are expected to assist in areas such as:   \\\\u2022 Dysphagia : for participants who have trouble eating, drinking or swallowing on a daily basis.   \\\\u2022 Respiratory : for participants requiring help with their breathing and maintenance of their  respiratory health, including any associated care, comfort, planning or supports   \\\\u2022 Nutrition : for participants requiring help with the way they eat or understanding the food they  need.   \\\\u2022 Diabetes : for participants who have daily problems with how much sugar is in their blood.   \\\\u2022 Continence : for participants who need daily assistance with toileting (bladder and bowel).   \\\\u2022 Wound & Pressure Care : for participants who need daily wound and pressure care  (resulti ng from pressure wounds or swollen limbs).   \\\\u2022 Podiatry : for participants who require help looking after their feet, ankles and lower limbs.   \\\\u2022 Epilepsy : for participants who need daily help managing the way epilepsy affects the way  their brain and nerves work.   \\\\u2022 Botox and Splinting : It is unlikely Botox and splinting supports will be reasonable and  necessary to include in a plan, as these are generally provided in a clinical setting.   Five types of disability -related health supports have been identified in the NDIS Support Catalogue :  \\\\u2022 Provision of Disability -Related Health Supports by Disability Support Workers \\\\u2013 these  supports should be claimed using the standard Daily Personal Activities and High Intensity  Daily Personal Activities support items;   \\\\u2022 Assessment, planni ng and the provision of Disability -Related Health Supports by therapists  these supports should be claimed using the standard early childhood and Therapy support  items;   \\\\u2022 Assessment, planning and the provision of Disability -Related Health Supports by nurses \\\\u2013  these supports should be claimed using the new nursing support items;\", \"page_label: 38 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  Special NDIS Pricing Arrangements   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 38 of 101 \\\\u2022 Consumables related to Disability Related Health Supports \\\\u2013 these supports should be  claimed using the new Low -Cost or High -Cost Disability Related Health Consumables  support line items ; and   \\\\u2022 Assistive Technology related to Disability Related Health Supports \\\\u2013 these supports should  be claimed using the new Disability Related Health Assistive Technology support line items.

Examples of situations where Irregular SIL Supports would be required  include a participant falling ill or the cancellation of a day program, so that participants are in their  home and require SIL supports for a period that was not initially planned and rostered for.   Claims for Irregular SIL supports are made using the relevant support item, usin g the \\\\u201cIrregular SIL  Support\\\\u201d option in the myplace portal.   SIL Providers are only permitted to claim from a participant\\\\u2019s plan for Irregular SIL Supports if all of  the following conditions are met:   \\\\u2022 The NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits  indicates that providers can claim for  Irregular SIL Supports in r espect of that support item;   \\\\u2022 The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and  Price Limits ;  \\\\u2022 Where the SIL activity  does not sit within the definition of a Regular SIL Supports;   \\\\u2022 The provider works with the participant and/or their nominee to explain why Irregular SIL  Supports are required, and the other options available; and   \\\\u2022 The provider has agreement from the partici pant and/or their nominee to claim for the  support before a payment request is made (i.e. , the service agreement between the  participant and the provider should specify that Irregular SIL Supports can be claimed when  required) .  In contrast, Regular SIL sup ports (claimed as Direct Services) are considered as those planned for  as part of a usual week in the SIL plan budget, via  an agreement with the participant and provider  based on the levels of care that can be provided within the approved SIL budget .  The S IL Operational Guideline provides more detail about the types of services that are included  and excluded from the provision of SIL supports.\", \"page_label: 32 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 32 of 101 Claiming for more than one worker or therapist   Sometimes a participant requires assistance from more than one worke r or therapist at the same  time. In these cases, the provider is entitled to bill for the time spent providing the support by all  workers and therapists involved in delivering the support. Examples of cases where this may occur  include:   \\\\u2022 Shadow shifts  that allow new workers to be introduced to a participant who has complex  individual support needs so that they can understand their support needs and patterns;   \\\\u2022 Supervision of, or specific training for, therapy assistants by the supervising therapist as part  of the handover of the support delivery to the participant by the therapist to the therapy  assistant;   \\\\u2022 Case conferences between therapists about the specific s upport needs of a participant.   Shadow Shifts   Shadow shifts may be claimed where the participant has complex individual support needs that are  best met by introducing a new worker to the participant before it is reasonable that they commence  providing the s upport independently \\\\u2013 for example, where the specific individual support needs  include very limited communication; behaviour support needs; and/or medical needs/procedures  such as ventilation or Home Enteral Nutrition (HEN).   Where the individual would require shadow shifts to assist with the introduction of new workers,  and this is the desired method by the participant or their family, the provider may claim for up to 6  hours of weekday support per year.   Supervision / Specific Training for Therapy Assistants   Level 1 Therapy Assistants can only deliver support under the direct supervision of a therapist.  Level 2 Therapy Assistants can deliver supports under indirect supervision but may require specific  training in the needs of the partici pant from the therapist before they take responsibility for the  delivery of the therapy.   In these cases, it is appropriate for the provider to bill for the time spent by both the therapist and  the therapy assistant. This arrangement can represent value for  money for the participant  compared to the alternative of all support s being delivered by the supervising therapists.   Case Conferences for Therapists   Therapists, especially in rural and remote areas, may benefit from a case conference with other  therapists  about the specific care needs of a participant. In these cases, it is appropriate for the  provider to bill for the time spent by all therapists on the case conference.   Other Considerations   Supports must be Reasonable and Necessary   The NDIS provides fundin g to participants for supports and services aimed at increasing their  independence, inclusion, and social and economic participation.   Supports funded by the NDIS need to:   \\\\u2022 Be related to the participant \\\\u2019s disability;\", \"page_label: 33 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 33 of 101 \\\\u2022 Not include day -to-day living costs that are not related to a participant \\\\u2019s disability support  needs;   \\\\u2022 Represent value for money; and   \\\\u2022 Be likely to be effective and beneficial to the participant.   Providers should not claim for supports from a participant\\\\u2019s plan where the support is not in line  with the participant\\\\u2019s goals, objectives and aspirations as set out in their plan or where the support  is not reasonable and necessary. Providers should also not claim for supports from a participant\\\\u2019s  plan where the support is more appropriately funded or pro vided through other service systems.  Further information on when a support is considered reasonable and necessary can be found on  the NDIS w ebsite .  Medicare and Insurance   Some elements of a participant\\\\u2019s care may be covered by funds outside the NDIS. These  expenses are commonly medical, including those  covered by private health insurance or Medicare.  These medical expenses are not funded under the NDIS, even if they are related to, or a symptom  of, the disability. These expenses should be claimed under the relevant health care scheme or  insurance policy. Some providers (e.g. , therapists) may need to di stinguish between the health  services and disability supports that they provide to a single client, and make separate payment  claims to, for example,  Medicare and the NDIS.   Expenses Related to Recreational Pursuits   Providers should not claim payment from participant\\\\u2019s plans for:   \\\\u2022 Expenses related to recreational pursuits, such as event tickets for the participant, as they  are not covered by the NDIS; or   \\\\u2022 The cost of entry for a paid support worker to attend a social or recreational event.   Prepayments   In general, Registered Providers can only make a claim for payment once a service booking has  been created and the support has been delivered or provided.   For higher cost supports, the cost of the support may be claimed  in stages in some circu mstances,  and before the support is finally delivered to the participant.   Prepayments represent funds paid in advance of the provider delivering the agreed support to the  participant. Sometimes providers require prepayment(s) as collateral and/or to cover  their  expenses in order to source, build or tailor the support to meet the participant\\\\u2019s unique need s.   In general,  prepayments should only be sought where a business will incur unrecoverable costs  should delivery of the support to the requesting particip ant not proceed (e.g. , a custo m-made  support).   Prepayments are subject to all of the following conditions:   \\\\u2022 The support item is an assistive technology (including vehicle modification), or a home  modification ;  \\\\u2022 The support item value exceeds $1,500 or is custom made to address the participant\\\\u2019s  disability related requirements, and a valid quote has been provided and accepted by the  participant (or their nominee) ;\", \"page_label: 34 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 34 of 101 \\\\u2022 a service agreement between the provider and participant (or nominee) outlines the  requirement  of a prepayment (e.g. , deposit) or milestone payments, in line with normal  business practice ; and   \\\\u2022 The final payment of not less than 10% of the total cost , may not be claimed until the  participant has received the support ready for use.   A participant is entitled to a refund of any balance of prepayment(s) less the actual unrecoverable  expense incurred by the business to that point when supply is termina ted. The participant remains  fully entitled to their rights under Australian Consumer Law in all circums tances.   Prepayments can be claimed by providers for a support where that support is specifically identified  as eligible for prepayments  in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits . Other supports  may be eligible for prepayment where the NDIA has give n prior written approval (including  conditions) to the registered pro vider to claim for prepayments.   Subscription services   In some cases, a  provider may claim for a service agreed with a participant using a subscription  model of payment. In these cases, t he participant is paying to be able to use that service (on the  terms/hours agreed) for the period of the subscription. Subscriptions may only be used for the  supply of the following supports: Consumables  (Support Category 03) and Assistive  Technology  (Supp ort Category 05).   Providers wanting to claim for a subscription -based  service must make sure that:   \\\\u2022 A plain English service agreement has been accepted by the participant, that makes clear to  the participant the service and its costs (including any extra fe es), as well as reasonable exit  conditions   \\\\u2022 The maximum price limit for a subscription is $5,000 per annum.   \\\\u2022 Subscriptions are  to be  charged monthly (paid at or before the start of the service period) .  Small subscriptions, where the annual cost is not more than $1,500, may be charged less  frequently (quarterly or annually) . For example,  if a subscription service cost $199 per year, it  could be charged for just once per year.   \\\\u2022 There are no penalties (for example exit fees) should a participant wish to can cel a  subscription (with reasonable  one mont h\\\\u2019s notice) on or prior to the end of the paid  subscription period.   \\\\u2022 Invoices for the subscription to be paid, clearly describe the supports for the participant to be  delivered/available during the subscription pe riod. For monthly subscriptions, participants   may agree in writing to be billed quarterly (in advance of the quarter), but must be refunded  any unused months if they cancel the subscription with due notice (as stated above).   High value subscription claimin g applies where the bundle of available Assistive Technology  Products that a participant can access at any time is more than $15,000.   Under high value AT, all the conditions of the subscription services apply, with exception to the  maximum price limit, which is set to $10,000 per annum.   Additional payments are permitted for high value AT subscriptions as follows:   a) freight and in -home technical setup costs may be claimed at the commencement of the  subscription;\", \"page_label: 35 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  General Claiming Rules   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 35 of 101 b) removal, and return to provider\\\\u2019s agen t nearest to the participant\\\\u2019s residence, of the  supplied AT at the end of the subscription (which may coincide with the death of the  participant); and   c) each such claim under a) or b) shall not exceed one (1) month\\\\u2019s subscription fee or $600,  whichever is l ess.  Co-payments for Capital items, including Assistive T echnology   In general, providers are not permitted to request a c o-payment  by the  participant for a support .  However, where a participant would like a customisation to a support or assistive technology that is  not considered reasonable or necessary, they are required to pay for these  themselves. These  may include an aesthetic customisation to an assistive technology or modificat ions to a vehicle that  are additional to the assistive components.   Other Fees and Charges   All registered providers must not add any other charge to the cost of the supports they provide to  any participant, such as credit card surcharges, or any additional fees including any \\\\u2018gap\\\\u2019 fees, late  payment fees or cancellation fees, unless otherwise permitted by the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements  and Price Limits . Participants are generally not required to pay exit fees, even when changing  provider\\\\u2019s  part way through a plan. A core principle of the NDIS is choice and control for  participants, allowing them to ch ange providers without expense.   Goods and Services Tax (GST)   Many, but not all, NDIA supports provided to NDIS participants are GST -free. Further information  abou t the NDIS and GST can be accessed on the Australian Taxation Office website . Providers  should seek independent legal or fina ncial advice if they require assistance with tax law  compliance. If GST is applicable to a support,  the price limit is inclusive of GST.\", \"page_label: 36 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023 -24 Version 1. 0 (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 36 of 101 Special NDIS Pricing Arrangements   High Intensity Supports   A support is considered a High Intensity support if it is a support provided to a participant:   \\\\u2022 For whom frequent (at least 1 instance per shift) assistance is required to manage  challenging behaviours that require intensive positive behaviour support; and/or   \\\\u2022 Who requires assistance fro m a disability support worker who has one or more of the high  intensity support skills specified in the NDIS Commission \\\\u2019s NDIS Practice Standards: skills  descriptors , which can be downloaded  here .  Temporary Transformation Payment (TTP)   A number of supports in the Assistance with Daily Living Support Category and the Social ,  Economic  and Community Participation Support Category are in the scope of the Temporary  Transformation Payment (TTP). These supports have two support items , in line with the following  example .   01_011_0107_1_1  Assistance Wi th Self -Care Activities \\\\u2013 Standard \\\\u2013 Weekday Daytime   01_011_0107_1_1_T  Assistance With Self -Care Activities \\\\u2013 Standard \\\\u2013 Weekday Daytime \\\\u2013 TTP  The price limit for each TTP item is higher than the price limit for the non -TTP item. The difference  in price limits will be  1.5% of the standard price from 1 July  2023.  As with all supports, providers must also agree the price that they will charge for a support with the  participant. The price for a support cannot be greater than the relevant price limit.   The TTP items can only be used by providers who are compliant with the TTP conditions (see  below). Providers who meet these eligibility criteria are known as TTP providers .  All providers who claim for the TTP in 2023 -24 must:   \\\\u2022 Publish their service prices p rominently on their website, and make them available to  particip ants, including participants who are not their clients, and the NDIA on request; and   \\\\u2022 List their business contact details in the Provider Finder in the myplace portal  and ensure  that those deta ils are kept up -to-date.  In addition, providers who made a claim for the TTP in 2022 -23 can only claim for the TTP in 2023 - 24 if they also took part in the Financial Benchmarking Survey that was carried out for the NDIA in  2021 -22.  All providers who claim for a TTP support item are also required  to acknowledge their compliance  with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits , including the TTP requirements, when  submitting a payment request through the myplace Provider Portal.   Providers are reminded that Section 182 of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013   provides that if a NDIS amount is paid to a person who is not entitled for any reason to the  payment of the NDIS amount then the amount of the payment is a debt due to the Agency.   Plan Managers and the TTP   Plan managers are not  responsible for ensuring pr oviders are TTP compliant. They can accept the  claim for a TTP support item by a registered provider as proof of TTP compliance. Plan managers\", \"page_label: 37 file_name: PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf  Special NDIS Pr icing Arrangements   NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 202 3-24 Version 1.0  (published 16/06/2023 )  Page 37 of 101 are however required to inform the NDIA, when requested, which registered providers have made  a claim for a TTP s upport item through the plan manager. N on-registered providers are not eligible  for the TTP and plan managers should not use TTP line items to claim for services delivered by  non-registered providers.   Disability -Related Health Supports   The NDIS will fund d isability -related health supports where these supports directly relate to a  participant\\\\u2019s significant and permanent functional impairment and assist them to undertake  activities of daily living. These supports are provided individually to participants and can be  provided in a range of environments, including, but not limited to, the participant\\\\u2019s own home.   Participants are not permitted to claim for health supports from their plans when those health  supports do not relate to their disability and when they d o not require health supports on a regular  basis. Those health supports will continue to be provided by the health system. Additionally, if a  participant\\\\u2019s support needs become acute, that support should be provided in a hospital or another  health setting by the relevant state/territory health care system or private health system and not be  claimed from the participant\\\\u2019s plan.   The list below provides an indication of the majority of disability -related health supports that may  be required by NDIS participan ts; however, it is not an exhaustive list. Disability -related health  supports are expected to assist in areas such as:   \\\\u2022 Dysphagia : for participants who have trouble eating, drinking or swallowing on a daily basis.   \\\\u2022 Respiratory : for participants requiring help with their breathing and maintenance of their  respiratory health, including any associated care, comfort, planning or supports   \\\\u2022 Nutrition : for participants requiring help with the way they eat or understanding the food they  need.   \\\\u2022 Diabetes : for participants who have daily problems with how much sugar is in their blood.   \\\\u2022 Continence : for participants who need daily assistance with toileting (bladder and bowel).   \\\\u2022 Wound & Pressure Care : for participants who need daily wound and pressure care  (resulti ng from pressure wounds or swollen limbs).   \\\\u2022 Podiatry : for participants who require help looking after their feet, ankles and lower limbs.   \\\\u2022 Epilepsy : for participants who need daily help managing the way epilepsy affects the way  their brain and nerves work.   \\\\u2022 Botox and Splinting : It is unlikely Botox and splinting supports will be reasonable and  necessary to include in a plan, as these are generally provided in a clinical setting.

Short Term Accommodation and Assistance  (including the provision of respite care)   Standard Support Items    These support items provide integrated support for self-care, accommodation, food and  activities in  a centre or group residence for short periods. They recognise that, from time to time, participants  may require temporary comprehensive supports that are di fferent from their usual arrangements.  These are non -typical days and may include Short Term Accommodation (STA) in a group -based  facility. They may also include a period of respite, which aims to support ongoing caring  arrangements between participants an d their carers. STA/respite allows the opportunity for the  participant to be supported by someone else whilst providing their carer with short term breaks  from their usual caring responsibilities.    The support  items  include all expenses in a 24 -hour period  including assistance with self -care or  community access activities, accommodation, food and negotiated activities. Typically, this type of  support would be used for short periods of up to 14 days a t a time (exceptions may be made ). For  longer -term arrange ments, other options are likely to be more appropriate ( e.g., Supported  Independent Living or Medium Term Accommodation).   In cases where a participant will receive substantially less than 24 hours of assistance with daily  personal activities, it may be app ropriate for the participant and provider to negotiate a lower price  than the maximum price specified in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits , based on  the actual hours of support provided. This situation might arise, for example, if a participant enters  a STA/respite facility in the evening, and exits again early the following morning. In addition, where  a participant enters accommodation late in the day, it may be appropriate to claim the daily rate for  the day of the week that the maj ority of the support is provided.   These support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the  NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits .   As well as direct service provision , these support items can be used to claim  for:  \\\\u2022 Short Notice Cancellations .

Short Term Accommodation and Assistance  (including the provision of respite care)   Standard Support Items    These support items provide integrated support for self-care, accommodation, food and  activities in  a centre or group residence for short periods. They recognise that, from time to time, participants  may require temporary comprehensive supports that are di fferent from their usual arrangements.  These are non -typical days and may include Short Term Accommodation (STA) in a group -based  facility. They may also include a period of respite, which aims to support ongoing caring  arrangements between participants an d their carers. STA/respite allows the opportunity for the  participant to be supported by someone else whilst providing their carer with short term breaks  from their usual caring responsibilities.    The support  items  include all expenses in a 24 -hour period  including assistance with self -care or  community access activities, accommodation, food and negotiated activities. Typically, this type of  support would be used for short periods of up to 14 days a t a time (exceptions may be made ). For  longer -term arrange ments, other options are likely to be more appropriate ( e.g., Supported  Independent Living or Medium Term Accommodation).   In cases where a participant will receive substantially less than 24 hours of assistance with daily  personal activities, it may be app ropriate for the participant and provider to negotiate a lower price  than the maximum price specified in the NDIS  Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits , based on  the actual hours of support provided. This situation might arise, for example, if a participant enters  a STA/respite facility in the evening, and exits again early the following morning. In addition, where  a participant enters accommodation late in the day, it may be appropriate to claim the daily rate for  the day of the week that the maj ority of the support is provided.

The transitional arrangements mean that providers delivering group or centre based supports in  the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation Support  Category who require  time to transition to the new group -based  pricin g arrangements set out on page 28 can choose to  continue to use the pricing arrangements and support items that were in place in 2019 -20.  The transitional arrangements have price limits that are inclusive of Non-Face -to-Face Support  Prov ision  and Centre Capital Costs , and so these components cannot be claimed separately by  providers using the transitional support items.   A provider can either conti nue to use the transitional pricing arrangements for group and centre  based supports or they can choose to switch to the new pricing arrangements for group and centre  based supports.   A provider must use the same approach (transitional or new) for all the group and centre based  supports that they deliver.

The transitional arrangements mean that providers delivering group or centre based supports in  the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation Support  Category who require  time to transition to the new group -based  pricin g arrangements set out on page 28 can choose to  continue to use the pricing arrangements and support items that were in place in 2019 -20.  The transitional arrangements have price limits that are inclusive of Non-Face -to-Face Support  Prov ision  and Centre Capital Costs , and so these components cannot be claimed separately by  providers using the transitional support items.   A provider can either conti nue to use the transitional pricing arrangements for group and centre  based supports or they can choose to switch to the new pricing arrangements for group and centre  based supports.   A provider must use the same approach (transitional or new) for all the group and centre based  supports that they deliver.   Once a provider commences to use the new pricing arrangements they may no longer use the  transitional pricing arrangements .

Therapy supports are  for participants with an established disability  to facilitate functional improvement , where maximum  medical improvement has been reached . For people who access the Scheme as \\\\u2018early  intervention\\\\u2019 participants, reasonable and necessary supports are likely to be a blend of medical  and disability  therapies but should be predominantly disabili ty therapy supports. Therapy must be  aimed at adjustment, adaption, and building capacity for community participation.    Maintenance care can be claimed against a participant\\\\u2019s plan, where the primary purpose i s to  provide ongoing support for a participant to maintain a level of functioning including long term  therapy/support required to achieve small incremental gains or to prevent functional decline.  In  general, maintenance therapy that is reasonable and neces sary should be delivered by carers who  are or can be trained in this if required. Where a participant has a medical condition or disability  that requires a particular regime to maintain functioning of a body part, or to slow the deterioration  of a medical condition or body part, then these support items can be used to deliver reasonable  and necessary training for non -qualified personnel to assist a participant, as part of usual daily  care. These support items cannot be used for massage, delivered directly t o impact a body part or  body system, as these supports are more appropriately funded by the health system.   These support items can also be used for the assessment, planning, and delivery of Disability - Related Health Supports  where these supports directly relate to a participant\\\\u2019s significant and  permanent functional impairment and assist them to undertake activities of daily living.

Participants should not spend more than $750 on electronic devices needed to maintain existing  services. In the case of computer tablets or iPads for telehealth and care or participating in online  video classes, advice from AT specialists is that most NDIS  participants will not need more than a  standard tablet, which costs no more than $600.   The following items and circumstances are excluded from this policy:   \\\\u2022 The item does not relate to the participants disability.

Disney fired him from the film in July 2018 following the resurfacing of controversial posts on Twitter, but the studio reversed course by that October and reinstated him. Gunn\\'s return was publicly revealed in March 2019, with production resuming after he completed work for DC on The Suicide Squad (2021) and the first season of its spin-off series Peacemaker (2022). Filming began in November 2021 at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and lasted until May 2022.\\\\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 premiered at Disneyland Paris on April 22, 2023, and was released in the United States on May 5, as part of Phase Five of the MCU. Like its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success. The film was praised for Gunn\\'s direction and screenplay, its soundtrack, visuals, action sequences, performances, emotional weight and humor; many deemed the film as a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy. It grossed over $845 million worldwide, and becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2023.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Plot ==\\\\nAt their new headquarters on Knowhere, the Guardians of the Galaxy are attacked by Adam, a Sovereign warrior created by their high priestess Ayesha, who seeks to destroy the Guardians for stealing from her. After Adam critically wounds Rocket, he is stabbed by Nebula and flees.\\\\nTriplets:\\\\n\"], \"model\": \"text-davinci-002\", \"temperature\": 0.0, \"max_tokens\": 256, \"top_p\": 1, \"frequency_penalty\": 0, \"presence_penalty\": 0, \"n\": 1, \"logit_bias\": {}}' message='Post details'\n"

Filming was previously scheduled to begin in January or February 2019 prior to Gunn\\'s firing, and then in February 2021, before Gunn began work on Peacemaker. With the start of filming, Sylvester Stallone revealed that he would return as Stakar Ogord from Vol. 2, and Gunn posted a photo of the main cast members which revealed that Chukwudi Iwuji was part of the film following his collaboration with Gunn on Peacemaker. Iwuji\\'s screen test for the film was shot on the set of Peacemaker with that series\\' crew, and Marvel repaid this favor by letting Gunn use the Vol. 3 set and crew to film Ezra Miller\\'s cameo appearance as Barry Allen / The Flash for the Peacemaker season finale.Production designer Beth Mickle said Gunn chose to mainly use practical effects for Vol. 3 after they did so with their work on The Suicide Squad. In February 2021, Gunn stated the film would be shot using Industrial Light & Magic\\'s StageCraft virtual production technology that was developed for the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian, but in October, he said they would not be able to use the technology because the sets were too big, believing they were larger than the sets used on The Suicide Squad. The interior of the Guardians\\' new ship, the Bowie, was a four-story set. Judianna Makovsky serves as costume designer. The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special was filmed at the same time as Vol. 3, from February to late April 2022, with the same main cast and sets.

In mixed reviews, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian and Nicholas Barber of the BBC agreed the film was overlong, Barber opining that \\\\\"the film\\'s saving grace is that, just as Gunn has been allowed to unleash his gonzo imagination, he has also been allowed to pour out his emotions.\\\\\" Wendy Ide of The Observer lauded the films for its emotional weight and deemed it a satisfying conclusion, stating that \\\\\"What elevates Vol 3 (supposedly the final film in the GOTG series) is the way it keeps that personality, nodding to the irreverent swagger that is a crucial component of the Guardians USP while delivering a series of devastating emotional sucker punches along the way.\\\\\" Matt Singer from ScreenCrush praised the film for concluding Rocket\\'s arc story stating that \\\\\"a character tells Rocket that the events unfolding onscreen have been his story all along \\\\u2014 and with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, it does feel like Marvel has spent $200 million on a movie about a melancholy space raccoon looking for love and acceptance.\\\\\" Writing for The Verge, Charles Pulliam-Moore praised the film\\'s action sequences and storyline and commented that \\\\\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 tells the action-packed, flashback-filled story of how Rocket Raccoon\\'s (Bradley Cooper) life being gravely endangered gives the rest of the Guardians a reason to come together and really start working on some of the emotional issues that\\'ve been haunting them since Endgame.\\\\\" The Hindustan Times praised Gunn\\'s direction and writing, commenting that \\\\\"As James Gunn concludes his journey with these characters he clearly cares so deeply about, you can\\'t help but reflect on your own. Walking out, I had my own little flashback montage playing in my head of all the adventures we\\'ve been on and foes we\\'ve faced with this lovable group of galaxy-saving idiots.\\\\\" Nathan Durr of CBS News praised the film\\'s soundtrack and stated that \\\\\"There\\'s no exception here regarding the soundtrack as Gunn and company cleverly implement songs that add weight to the complexities and emotions of the characters.\\\\nTriplets:\\\\n\"], \"model\": \"text-davinci-002\", \"temperature\": 0.0, \"max_tokens\": 256, \"top_p\": 1, \"frequency_penalty\": 0, \"presence_penalty\": 0, \"n\": 1, \"logit_bias\": {}}' message='Post details'\n",

Later in September, Gunn said he was unlikely to return for another Guardians film but would continue to work with Marvel Studios on other projects that use the Guardians and cosmic characters. One such project from Gunn was a film centered on Drax and Mantis, which Bautista called \\\\\"brilliant\\\\\". However, in May 2021, Bautista stated that he had not heard any further updates regarding it, feeling Marvel Studios was not \\\\\"very interested, or it doesn\\'t fit into the way they have things mapped out\\\\\". Gunn confirmed in September 2019 that he intended for Vol. 3 to be his last Guardians film, which he reaffirmed in May 2021. In July 2021, Gillan expressed her desire to continue playing Nebula after Vol. 3. In April 2023, Salda\\\\u00f1a confirmed that Vol. 3 would be the last time she portrays Gamora, but hoped Marvel would recast the role with a younger actor because she wished for the character to continue. The following month, Pratt indicated his willingness to continue playing Peter Quill in the future if the right script came along, and a note at the end of Vol. 3\\'s post-credits scene states that the \\\\\"Legendary Star-Lord\\\\\" would return to the MCU.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== Notes ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== References ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n== External links ==\\\\n\\\\nOfficial website  at Marvel.com\\\\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 at IMDb\\\\nTriplets:\\\\n\"], \"model\": \"text-davinci-002\", \"temperature\": 0.0, \"max_tokens\": 256, \"top_p\": 1, \"frequency_penalty\": 0, \"presence_penalty\": 0, \"n\": 1, \"logit_bias\": {}}' message='Post details'\n",
