       " Document(page_content='Introduction\\n1. Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) is one of the supports that may be funded under\\nthe National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) for some participants. SDA funding is\\nprovided to participants who require a specialist dwelling that reduces their need for person-to-\\nperson supports, or improves the efficiency of the delivery of person-to-person supports. SDA\\nfunding is only provided for participants who meet the eligibility criteria. Participants who meet\\nthe eligibility criteria will have an extreme functional impairment and/or very high support\\nneeds.\\n2. In brief, in order to receive NDIS SDA payments in respect of a participant living in a dwelling:\\n(i) the provider must be a registered NDIS provider with the NDIS Quality and Safeguards\\nCommission (NDIS Q&SC); and\\n(ii) the provider must be approved for the SDA Registration Group by the NDIS Q&SC; and\\n(iii) the provider must have enrolled the dwelling with the NDIA; and\\n(iv) the SDA payment must be equal to or less than the maximum amount that the NDIA has\\ndetermined that it will pay based on the age, location and features of the dwelling; and\\n(v) the NDIA must have determined that SDA is a reasonable and necessary support for the\\nparticipant.1\\nLegislative framework\\n3. The legislative framework for providing SDA to participants under the NDIS, including the\\ncriteria for when a participant will have SDA included in their NDIS plan, the dwellings that can\\nbe used for SDA and the payments that will be paid to providers of SDA are set out in:\\n(i) the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 (the NDIS Act) and the NDIS Rules\\nunder the Act, including the NDIS (Specialist Disability Accommodation) Rules 2020\\n(SDA Rules) and the NDIS (Specialist Disability Accommodation Conditions) Rule 2018\\n(SDA NDIS Q&SC Rule), which incorporate the NDIS (Specialist Disability\\nAccommodation Conditions) Amendment Rules 2020;\\n(ii) this NDIS Pricing Arrangements for SDA; and\\n(iii) the general NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits.\\n4. This NDIS Pricing Arrangements for SDA is referred to as the SDA Price Guide in the SDA\\nRules and contains further detail regarding the Design Categories and Building Types\\ndescribed in the SDA Rules.\\n5.

The form of OOA varies between Building Type and the amount of the OOA assistance\\npayment made in relation to this room, as a consequence, may depend on whether access to\\nthe OOA is shared between multiple dwellings.\\n68.

Only dwellings in the Robust Design Category can have an additional breakout room.\\n70. Only dwellings with more than one bedroom can have an additional breakout room.\\n71. Apartments cannot have an additional breakout room.\\n72. A breakout room is a separate room designed to respond to the individual disability related\\nneeds of the participant.

The Base Price Limits for each type of dwelling are set out in:\\n(i) Appendix A – Base Price Limits for Post-2023 New Builds\\n(ii) Appendix B – Base Price Limits for Pre-2023 New Builds\\n(iii) Appendix C – Base Price Limits for Existing Stock\\n(iv) Appendix D – Base Price Limits for Legacy Stock\\n78. In general, SDA Legacy properties with 11 or more residents are no longer eligible for SDA\\npayments. Any exceptions to this rule are set out in Appendix D – Base Price Limits for\\nLegacy Stock.\\n79. For SDA Legacy properties with 6 to 10 residents, SDA payments will cease after the end of\\nthe immediate ten-year period after the property’s location transitioned into the NDIS.\\nStep 2: Identify the Location Factor\\n80. The Location Factors applied in SDA pricing are based on Australian Bureau of Statistics\\n(ABS) Statistical Area 4 regions from 2021. See: ABS Statistical Area 4.\\n81. To derive an SDA price limit for a particular dwelling, the Base Price is multiplied by the\\nLocation Factor relevant to the property’s location and Building Type.\\n82. The Location Factors are set out in:\\n(i) Appendix E – Location Factors for New Builds\\n(ii) Appendix F – Location Factors for Existing and Legacy Stock.\\nStep 3: Calculate the SDA Price Limit\\n83. To calculate the annual SDA price limit for a dwelling, the annual Base Price Limit per\\nparticipant is multiplied by the relevant Location Factor. This calculation is shown in the\\nformula below:\\nAnnual SDA price limit = Annual Base Price x Location Factor\\nStep 4: Calculate the SDA Price (shared living arrangements)\\n84.

       " Document(page_content='Introduction\\nThe National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 (NDIS Act) states that a funded support must\\nrepresent “value for money” in that the costs of the support are reasonable, relative to both the\\nbenefits achieved and the cost of alternative support.\\nDetermining whether a support is reasonable and necessary for an individual participant will be\\nguided by the NDIS Act (2013), the associated NDIS Rules, and the National Disability Insurance\\nAgency’s (NDIA) Operational Guidelines. These can be found on the NDIA website.\\nThis Guide is not a comprehensive list of all Assistive Technology (AT) supports that may be\\nprovided as reasonable and necessary under the NDIS, but lists the most commonly used supports\\nto assist providers to claim payments using a “best-fit” approach, and to assist participants with\\nconsistent terminology for AT comparison.\\nAs with other support categories, AT has many specific supports and services that are recognised\\nin the NDIS payment system, and these are referred to as ‘line items’. A comprehensive listing of\\nAT support line items is kept up to date in a separate file (csv format) on the NDIS website.\\nAll providers from each state and territory can now register with the NDIS Quality and Safeguards\\nCommission.\\nSupport Purpose\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant budgets\\noften have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support budgets, but cannot\\nreallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or capacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and skills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners explore where\\nsupports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These domains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships\\n4. Lifelong Learning 8. Choice and Control\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must\\ncontribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan.

       " Document(page_content='General Claiming Rules\\nWhen claiming, it is the responsibility of the provider to ensure that the claim accurately reflects the\\nsupports delivered, including the frequency and volume of supports. As a starting point, providers\\nshould claim against the relevant support line item which has been specified in the participant’s\\nplan, or as stated in the Service Booking with the participant. Only where there is no specific line\\nitem identified, providers should claim payments against the support line item that most closely\\naligns to the product or service they have delivered.\\nPayment requests should accurately reflect the Unit of Measure (UOM) indicated against the\\nSupport Item. Thus outright purchase will usually be for a single item (1 x $invoice each), while\\nthree hours of communication device programming would be 3 units against an hourly UOM (3 x\\n$charge/hr).\\nNote: Fractional units (e.g. 1.65 x $invoice each) are not permitted when claiming for assistive\\ntechnology products except with the written authorisation of the NDIA. Claims for the balance\\nremaining above the fixed price limits of a support item need to use the relevant ‘AT\\nSupplementary Charge’ code.\\nFor some supports (such as home or vehicle modifications), payments can be claimed in stages\\nwhere this has been agreed to in negotiated Service Agreement with the participant and the NDIA\\nhas given prior approval in writing to the Registered Provider (see below under Prepayments).\\nService Bookings\\nA Service Booking is the way a participant (other than those self-managing their NDIS funding)\\nengages with their chosen provider(s) online (unless their plan is part of the new NDIS PACE\\nsystem). This ensures that both parties are aware of the item proposed and price for service, and\\nthat the participant will be able to pay for the service. Detailed aspects of the provision of the\\nsupport should be clearly agreed with the participant in a Service Agreement.\\nWhere quotes are required, the myplace Portal will automatically generate and issue an\\nappropriate service booking after the quote has been provided and accepted.\\nIn all other cases, a service booking should be made at either the category level (where the\\nprovider will claim using multiple codes – e.g. for the AT, delivery, programming) or using the\\nsupport line item that most closely aligns to the product or service being delivered.\\nFor more information please refer to the NDIS website and search for ‘service booking’.\\nQuoting for AT or HM\\nQuotes are required from providers for the provision of AT where indicated in this Guide. In some\\ncases participants may also seek quotes for other items to compare between products.\\nParticipants can then decide whether or not to accept these quotes. The NDIA computer systems\\nnow make it possible for registered providers to submit their quote directly into the NDIA Business\\nSystems through myplace Portal, in response to a Request for Quote through the myplace Portal.\\nIt is important to note that not all quotes will be processed automatically. If the quote received is\\nhigher than NDIA thresholds for that support item, specific approval will be required from the NDIA,\\nalternatively the NDIA may offer reasonable and necessary funding based on the best available\\npricing from the market.

Warranty repair (including Australian Consumer Law warranties) of AT should be discussed with the\\nsupplier or manufacturer and is not a reasonable and necessary support. Low-cost repairs and maintenance (e.g., repairing a strap on a prosthesis) outside the warranty period should generally be paid using a low-cost AT Support\\nItem (allowing the greatest flexibility). Alternatively, the participant could use their unallocated Capital (AT) budget where appropriate.\\nHigher cost repairs (>$1,500) are likely to be covered by a quotable Repairs and Maintenance Support Item included in the participant’s plan.

       " Document(page_content=\"Home Modifications\\nHome Modifications (Support Category 06)\\nThis support category includes both Home Modifications (HM) and Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) supports. Additional information can be found in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements for Special Disability Accommodation.In\\nthis guide, Home Modifications (HM) are designed to provide safe access and comfortable mobility in frequently used areas within a participant’s home. Home modifications include design and construction, as well as installation of\\nfixtures or fittings and changes to structural and non-structural components of the home. The Home Modifications Guidance for Builders and Designers provides further clarity on the diverse range of home modifications that the NDIS\\nmay consider reasonable and necessary.\\nSome simple low-cost home adaptation items (<$1,500) may be claimed as Assistive Technology under the “Assistive products for household tasks and access” category. They should not be separately claimed if they are part of a\\nHome Modification support category (for example grab rails would be included in a Minor Bathroom modification).\\nAll Home Modification support needs must be assessed by an Occupational Therapist. Minor Home Modification (MHM) includes changes to a home that are relatively low risk and straightforward, non-structural, generally impact one\\nor two areas in a home and usually cost less than $20,000 in total. The pre-determined budgets allocated to participants who require MHM supports are based on current market costs that are updated periodically. Further detail is\\npublished in the Operational Guideline - Home Modifications. Providers should use the appropriate MHM code for the works undertaken, plus the MHM Practical Completion code (equivalent to 10% of the works budget) after the\\ncompletion of the works. Note: Budgets provided are in line with the expectation that GST would not apply (see Goods and Services Tax (GST)).\\nComplex Home Modifications (CHM) which involve structural changes and require a greater level of certification, require a detailed specification of works and up to two quotes. The CHM assessment must be undertaken by a suitably\\nqualified and/or experienced home modification assessor. Funding for a building construction practitioner (BCP) will be included to help the participant to explore the best options to achieve an accessible dwelling and help them\\nnavigate the CHM process. The BCP can also provide a cost estimate for the NDIA to review the CHM, otherwise 2 builder’s quotes are required.\\nAn approved CHM will be described against the specific home modification support item codes shown below.\\nCapital budget funding will be provided for modifications that are reasonable and necessary for the participant.

       " Document(page_content='Introduction\\nThe National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) was established in 2013 to support people\\nwith disability to pursue their goals, to help them to realise their full potential, to assist them\\nto participate in and contribute to society, and to empower them to exercise choice and\\ncontrol over their lives and futures. The NDIS provides funding to eligible individuals\\n(“participants”) so that they can purchase, in the open market, the disability related goods\\nand services (“supports”) that they need. The NDIS is administered by the National Disability\\nInsurance Agency (NDIA). The NDIA has a role, as market steward, to create an efficient\\nand sustainable consumer driven marketplace for the supply of disability supports. It\\nregulates the commercial relationships between providers and participants, including through\\nprice regulation. The pricing arrangements aim to maintain and increase market supply, and\\nhelp markets grow to a more mature state in the future, while recognising the need for\\nfinancial sustainability. Further information on the NDIA’s approach to pricing can be found in\\nthe NDIS Pricing Strategy and in the Final Report of the Annual Pricing Review 2022-23.\\nThe NDIA uses the Disability Support Worker Cost Model that is described in this document\\nto determine the price limits for supports that are delivered by Disability Support Workers\\n(DSWs).\\nThe DSW Cost Model estimates the fully loaded cost of a billable hour of support\\nconsidering : base pay; shift loadings; leave entitlements; salary on costs; employee\\nallowances; operational overheads (including supervision costs, utilisation costs and\\nworkers’ compensation costs); corporate overheads and margin.\\nThe Cost Model estimates the efficient costs of providing supports by considering:\\n• Base Salary costs, including shift loadings. Note that in the Cost Model, costs are\\nbased on permanent worker costs.\\n• Direct On-costs, which covers those costs of employment associated with\\nSuperannuation entitlements, Annual Leave entitlements, Personal Leave\\nentitlements, Long Service Leave entitlements and Employee Allowances.\\n• Operational Overheads, which covers those costs that are in the operational control\\nof the provider and include workers compensation costs, utilisation costs (billable\\nversus unbillable hours), supervision costs (including quality and safeguarding costs)\\nand workforce rostering and balance measures such as the share of the workforce that\\nis permanent or casual, and the extent to which overtime is used by the business.\\n• Corporate Overheads, which covers those costs incurred to run the administrative\\nside of a business. These costs include the accounting, human resources, legal,\\nmarketing, and information technology functions.\\n• Margin, which represents the return that the provider makes because of the provision\\nof working capital to the business.\\n• Temporary Loading which recognises the variable costs of COVID and of adjusting to\\nthe new provisions in the Social, Community, Home Care and Disability Services\\nIndustry Award 2010 (SCHADS Industry Award) that were come into effect on 1 July\\n2023. These costs are being closely monitored by the NDIA.\\n4', metadata={'source': '../../data/ndis/PB NDIS Disability Support Worker Cost Model Assumptions and Methodology 2023-24 v1.0.docx.pdf', 'file_path': '../../data/ndis/PB NDIS Disability Support Worker Cost Model Assumptions and Methodology 2023-24 v1.0.docx.pdf', 'page': 4, 'total_pages': 24, 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_Enabled': 'true', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_SetDate': '2022-06-03T05:38:54Z', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_Method': 'Privileged', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_Name': 'OFFICIAL', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_SiteId': 'cd778b65-752d-454a-87cf-b9990fe58993', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_ActionId': '6ac29806-62d7-47b3-9d41-8eb9e24f9ba2', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_ContentBits': '0', 'Title': ')', 'Author': 'CULLEN, David', 'Creator': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'CreationDate': \"D:20230616084154+10'00'\", 'ModDate': \"D:20230616084154+10'00'\", 'Producer': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Description of the Cost Model\\nThis section sets out the methodology and assumptions of the NDIS DSW Cost Model.\\nBase Salary and Shift Loadings\\nThe NDIA recognises that some Disability Support Workers are classified as Home Care\\nEmployees and others are classified as Social and Community Services Employees under\\nthe SCHADS Industry Award.1 The Cost Model take its parameters from the Social and\\nCommunity Services Employees section for the SCHADS Industry Award, which has the\\nmore generous provisions. The NDIA also recognises that some Disability Support Workers\\nare employed under Enterprise Bargaining Agreements (EBAs). However, these EBAs must\\nleave the worker no worse off overall than they would be under the relevant Award. Any\\nadditional benefits offered by EBAs over the Award have been agreed to by providers and\\nare often offset by productivity gains. The NDIA therefore considers the conditions set out in\\nthe Social and Community Services Employees section of the SCHADS Industry Award to\\nbe the most appropriate foundation for the DSW Cost Model.\\nThe NDIA recognises that providers must employ Disability Support Workers with different\\nskill levels and levels of experience to meet the different needs of participants. The Cost\\nModel therefore has different sets of cost assumptions for four types of workers that will be\\nreferred to as DSW Level 1, DSW Level 2, DSW Level 3 and DSW Level 4.\\nTable 1 sets out the Cost Model’s assumptions with respect to the base pay of DSWs.\\nTable 1: Assumed SCHADS Industry Award Classifications and Pay Rates, 1 July 2023\\nAssumed SCHADS Award Hourly\\nClassification Rate\\nDSW Level 1 2.3 $34.22\\nDSW Level 2 2.4/3.1 $35.57\\nDSW Level 3 3.2 $37.03\\nDSW Level 4 4.4 $44.68\\nTable 2 sets out the Cost Model’s assumptions with respect to shift loadings.2\\nTable 2: Shift Loadings, 1 July 2023\\nShift Permanent Loading\\nWeekday 0.0%\\nSaturday 50.0%\\nSunday 100.0%\\nPublic Holiday 150.0%\\nEvening Shift 12.5%\\nNight Shift 15.0%\\n1 The SCHADS Industry Award can be viewed here.\\n2 SCHADS Industry Award: Clauses 10.4(b), 26 and 29.3.\\n5', metadata={'source': '../../data/ndis/PB NDIS Disability Support Worker Cost Model Assumptions and Methodology 2023-24 v1.0.docx.pdf', 'file_path': '../../data/ndis/PB NDIS Disability Support Worker Cost Model Assumptions and Methodology 2023-24 v1.0.docx.pdf', 'page': 5, 'total_pages': 24, 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_Enabled': 'true', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_SetDate': '2022-06-03T05:38:54Z', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_Method': 'Privileged', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_Name': 'OFFICIAL', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_SiteId': 'cd778b65-752d-454a-87cf-b9990fe58993', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_ActionId': '6ac29806-62d7-47b3-9d41-8eb9e24f9ba2', 'MSIP_Label_2b83f8d7-e91f-4eee-a336-52a8061c0503_ContentBits': '0', 'Title': ')', 'Author': 'CULLEN, David', 'Creator': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'CreationDate': \"D:20230616084154+10'00'\", 'ModDate': \"D:20230616084154+10'00'\", 'Producer': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365'}),\n",

It assumes that the number of workers accessing family and domestic violence leave\\nto be 2.3%, with those accessing the leave assumed to be accessing the entire minimum\\nentitlement.\\nThe Cost Model also recognises that workers accrue Long Service Leave (LSL) entitlements\\nwhen they work and that again providers need to accrue the revenue to meet the costs of\\nthis leave accrual during the billable hours of the DSW. The Cost Model assumes that\\nworkers accrue 4⅓ days of long service leave each year.9 The Cost Model assumes that all\\nlong service leave entitlements are drawn on.\\nIn line with the SCHADS Industry Award, the Cost Model also provides a 17.5% loading for\\nannual leave to compensate workers for the shifts they would have otherwise taken.10\\n3 SCHADS Industry Award: Clause 25.1.\\n4 The National Employment Standards govern leave and several other conditions in Awards, and also may not\\nbe reduced by EBAs. https://www.fairwork.gov.au/employee-entitlements/national-employment-standards\\n5 https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/annual-leave\\n6 https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/public-holidays\\n7 https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/sick-and-carers-leave/paid-sick-and-carers-leave\\nNote: The Cost Model assumes all workers utilise all of their personal leave entitlement each year even\\nthough some workers may not use their entitlement.\\n8 https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/family-and-domestic-violence-leave/employer-guide-to-family-and-\\ndomestic-violence\\n9 https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/long-service-leave\\nNote: The Cost Model assumes all workers qualify for LSL accruals and that all workers will eventually access\\ntheir LSL entitlement.

CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required.

       " Document(page_content='General Claiming Rules\\nRegistered Providers can only make a claim for payment for a support once they have delivered or\\nprovided that support. Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal.

Examples of cases where this may occur\\ninclude:\\n• Shadow shifts that allow new workers to be introduced to a participant who has complex\\nindividual support needs so that they can understand their support needs and patterns;\\n• Supervision of, or specific training for, therapy assistants by the supervising therapist as part\\nof the handover of the support delivery to the participant by the therapist to the therapy\\nassistant;\\n• Case conferences between therapists about the specific support needs of a participant.\\nShadow Shifts\\nShadow shifts may be claimed where the participant has complex individual support needs that are\\nbest met by introducing a new worker to the participant before it is reasonable that they commence\\nproviding the support independently – for example, where the specific individual support needs\\ninclude very limited communication; behaviour support needs; and/or medical needs/procedures\\nsuch as ventilation or Home Enteral Nutrition (HEN).\\nWhere the individual would require shadow shifts to assist with the introduction of new workers,\\nand this is the desired method by the participant or their family, the provider may claim for up to 6\\nhours of weekday support per year.\\nSupervision / Specific Training for Therapy Assistants\\nLevel 1 Therapy Assistants can only deliver support under the direct supervision of a therapist.\\nLevel 2 Therapy Assistants can deliver supports under indirect supervision but may require specific\\ntraining in the needs of the participant from the therapist before they take responsibility for the\\ndelivery of the therapy.\\nIn these cases, it is appropriate for the provider to bill for the time spent by both the therapist and\\nthe therapy assistant.

They are available during the final months at school and\\ncontinue post school exit. These supports are designed to plan and implement a pathway to\\ninclusive employment, focussing on capacity building for goal achievement.

These supports will have an individualised approach, with a strong\\nemphasis on “try and test” work experience opportunities, (generally in work places that would pay\\naward wages). Capacity building should focus on hard and soft skill development.

However, research\\nundertaken by a capacity-building provider specifically linked to the needs of a participant and to\\nthe achievement of the participant’s goals may be billable as a Non-Face-to-Face support with the\\nparticipant’s prior agreement.\\nService agreements with each client can ‘pre-authorise’ these activities, but providers should only\\nclaim a support item from a participant’s plan if they have completed activities that are part of the\\nsupport for that participant.

Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 11 of 101\\n\\t4. Lifelong Learning\\t\\t\\t8. Choice and ControlSupport Purposes, Support Categories and Support Items\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n4. Lifelong Learning 8. Choice and Control\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must\\ncontribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan. Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101', metadata={'title': 'NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24', 'source': '/workspaces/IsabelleLangchain/src/ndis/../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'timestamp': '2023-08-06T09:01:37.029528', 'start_page': 11, 'end_page': 15}), 0.44298630952835083)]\n",

(Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 11 of 101\\n\\t4. Lifelong Learning\\t\\t\\t8. Choice and ControlSupport Purposes, Support Categories and Support Items\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n4. Lifelong Learning 8. Choice and Control\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must\\ncontribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan. Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and\\nproviders to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant’s goals.\\nThe following table shows the links between support purpose types, domains in the Outcomes\\nFramework and support categories.\\nPURPOSE OUTCOME DOMAIN 1.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101', metadata={'title': 'NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24', 'source': '/workspaces/IsabelleLangchain/src/ndis/../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'timestamp': '2023-08-06T09:01:37.029528', 'start_page': 11, 'end_page': 15})], 'question': 'What item code should I use when invoicing for a participant?

Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel. The non-labour costs should be claimed against the\\nrelevant “Provider Travel – non-labour costs” support item as indicated in the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits.\\nSupport items\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a worker is travelling to provide services to\\nmore than one participant in a ‘region’ then the provider should apportion the non-labour travel\\ncosts (including the return journey where applicable) between the participants, with the agreement\\nof each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7.

Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and\\nproviders to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant’s goals.\\nThe following table shows the links between support purpose types, domains in the Outcomes\\nFramework and support categories.\\nPURPOSE OUTCOME DOMAIN 1.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101'}\n",

Providers should assist participants to minimise the travel\\ncosts that they need to pay (for example, by co-ordinating appointments with other participants in\\nan area, so that travel costs can be shared between participants, or by considering the delivery of\\nthe support by telehealth where appropriate).\\nShort Notice Cancellations\\nWhere a provider has a Short Notice Cancellation (or no show), they are able to claim 100% of the\\nagreed fee associated with the activity from the participant’s plan, subject to the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits and the terms of the service agreement with the participant.\\nA cancellation is a short notice cancellation if the participant:\\n• Does not show up for a scheduled support within a reasonable time, or is not present at the\\nagreed place and within a reasonable time when the provider is travelling to deliver the\\nsupport; or\\n• Has given less than seven (7) clear days’ notice for a support.\\nFor supports delivered to a group of participants, if a participant cancels their attendance and if the\\nprovider is unable find another participant to attend the group session in their place then, if the\\nother requirements for a short notice cancellation are met, the provider is permitted to bill the\\nparticipant who has made the short notice cancellation at the previously agreed rate that they\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 22 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\t\\n\\tA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\t\\n\\tThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\t\\n\\tnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\t\\n\\twould have been spent providing the support.\\t\\n\\tIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\t\\n\\tprovider can claim for this support.

All other participants in the group\\nshould also be billed as though all participants had attended the group.\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a Short Notice Cancellation of the delivery of\\na support item to the participant if all of the following conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for Short\\nNotice Cancellations in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify that Short Notice Cancellations can be\\nclaimed); and\\n• The provider was not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and are\\nrequired to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.\\nClaims for a short notice cancellation should be made using the same support item as would have\\nbeen used if the support had been delivered, using the “Cancellation” option in the myplace portal.\\nThere is no hard limit on the number of short notice cancellations (or no shows) for which a\\nprovider can claim in respect of a participant. However, providers have a duty of care to their\\nparticipants and if a participant has an unusual number of cancellations, then the provider should\\nseek to understand why they are occurring. The NDIA will monitor claims for cancellations and may\\ncontact providers who have a participant with an unusual number of cancellations.\\nExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\nA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\nThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\nnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\nwould have been spent providing the support.\\nIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\nprovider can claim for this support. The claim should be made at the agreed rate for the service against the relevant\\nsupport item using the drop-down field “Cancellation”.\\nNDIA Requested Reports\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a NDIA Requested Report if all of the\\nfollowing conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for NDIA\\nRequested Reports in respect of that support item and the proposed charges for the activities\\ncomply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (i.e., the service agreement\\nwith the participant should specify that NDIA Requested Reports can be claimed); and\\n• The report is requested by the NDIA.\\nA report is considered to have been requested by the NDIA if it is a report that is required at the\\ncommencement of a plan that outlines plan objectives and goals, or at plan review that measures\\nfunctional outcomes against the originally stipulated goals, or that makes recommendations for\\nongoing needs (informal, community, mainstream or funded supports). Providers may also claim\\nfor other NDIA-requested therapy report that is stipulated as being required in a participant’s plan.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 23 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaims for NDIS requested reports should be made using the relevant support item, using the\\n“NDIA Report” option in the myplace portal.\\nClaiming for Activity Based Transport\\nActivity Based Transport – Social, Economic and Community Participation Supports\\nProviders of supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation\\nSupport Category (“community participation supports”) can, at the request of a participant,\\ntransport a participant to, or from, or as part of, a community participation support. In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

Providers should assist participants to minimise the travel\\ncosts that they need to pay (for example, by co-ordinating appointments with other participants in\\nan area, so that travel costs can be shared between participants, or by considering the delivery of\\nthe support by telehealth where appropriate).\\nShort Notice Cancellations\\nWhere a provider has a Short Notice Cancellation (or no show), they are able to claim 100% of the\\nagreed fee associated with the activity from the participant’s plan, subject to the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits and the terms of the service agreement with the participant.\\nA cancellation is a short notice cancellation if the participant:\\n• Does not show up for a scheduled support within a reasonable time, or is not present at the\\nagreed place and within a reasonable time when the provider is travelling to deliver the\\nsupport; or\\n• Has given less than seven (7) clear days’ notice for a support.\\nFor supports delivered to a group of participants, if a participant cancels their attendance and if the\\nprovider is unable find another participant to attend the group session in their place then, if the\\nother requirements for a short notice cancellation are met, the provider is permitted to bill the\\nparticipant who has made the short notice cancellation at the previously agreed rate that they\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 22 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\t\\n\\tA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\t\\n\\tThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\t\\n\\tnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\t\\n\\twould have been spent providing the support.\\t\\n\\tIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\t\\n\\tprovider can claim for this support.

All other participants in the group\\nshould also be billed as though all participants had attended the group.\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a Short Notice Cancellation of the delivery of\\na support item to the participant if all of the following conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for Short\\nNotice Cancellations in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify that Short Notice Cancellations can be\\nclaimed); and\\n• The provider was not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and are\\nrequired to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.\\nClaims for a short notice cancellation should be made using the same support item as would have\\nbeen used if the support had been delivered, using the “Cancellation” option in the myplace portal.\\nThere is no hard limit on the number of short notice cancellations (or no shows) for which a\\nprovider can claim in respect of a participant. However, providers have a duty of care to their\\nparticipants and if a participant has an unusual number of cancellations, then the provider should\\nseek to understand why they are occurring. The NDIA will monitor claims for cancellations and may\\ncontact providers who have a participant with an unusual number of cancellations.\\nExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\nA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\nThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\nnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\nwould have been spent providing the support.\\nIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\nprovider can claim for this support. The claim should be made at the agreed rate for the service against the relevant\\nsupport item using the drop-down field “Cancellation”.\\nNDIA Requested Reports\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a NDIA Requested Report if all of the\\nfollowing conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for NDIA\\nRequested Reports in respect of that support item and the proposed charges for the activities\\ncomply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (i.e., the service agreement\\nwith the participant should specify that NDIA Requested Reports can be claimed); and\\n• The report is requested by the NDIA.\\nA report is considered to have been requested by the NDIA if it is a report that is required at the\\ncommencement of a plan that outlines plan objectives and goals, or at plan review that measures\\nfunctional outcomes against the originally stipulated goals, or that makes recommendations for\\nongoing needs (informal, community, mainstream or funded supports). Providers may also claim\\nfor other NDIA-requested therapy report that is stipulated as being required in a participant’s plan.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 23 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaims for NDIS requested reports should be made using the relevant support item, using the\\n“NDIA Report” option in the myplace portal.\\nClaiming for Activity Based Transport\\nActivity Based Transport – Social, Economic and Community Participation Supports\\nProviders of supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation\\nSupport Category (“community participation supports”) can, at the request of a participant,\\ntransport a participant to, or from, or as part of, a community participation support. In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

However, research\\nundertaken by a capacity-building provider specifically linked to the needs of a participant and to\\nthe achievement of the participant’s goals may be billable as a Non-Face-to-Face support with the\\nparticipant’s prior agreement.\\nService agreements with each client can ‘pre-authorise’ these activities, but providers should only\\nclaim a support item from a participant’s plan if they have completed activities that are part of the\\nsupport for that participant.

Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 11 of 101\\n\\t4. Lifelong Learning\\t\\t\\t8. Choice and ControlSupport Purposes, Support Categories and Support Items\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n4. Lifelong Learning 8. Choice and Control\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must\\ncontribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan. Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101', metadata={'title': 'NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24', 'source': '/workspaces/IsabelleLangchain/src/ndis/../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'timestamp': '2023-08-06T09:01:37.029528', 'start_page': 11, 'end_page': 15}), 0.44298630952835083)]\n",

(Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7. Relationships\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 11 of 101\\n\\t4. Lifelong Learning\\t\\t\\t8. Choice and ControlSupport Purposes, Support Categories and Support Items\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n4. Lifelong Learning 8. Choice and Control\\nNDIS providers should be aware that all supports and services for NDIS participants must\\ncontribute to the achievement of their individual goals as outlined in the participant’s plan. Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and\\nproviders to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant’s goals.\\nThe following table shows the links between support purpose types, domains in the Outcomes\\nFramework and support categories.\\nPURPOSE OUTCOME DOMAIN 1.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101', metadata={'title': 'NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24', 'source': '/workspaces/IsabelleLangchain/src/ndis/../../data/ndis2/PB NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 .pdf', 'timestamp': '2023-08-06T09:01:37.029528', 'start_page': 11, 'end_page': 15})], 'question': 'What item code should I use when invoicing for a participant?

Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel. The non-labour costs should be claimed against the\\nrelevant “Provider Travel – non-labour costs” support item as indicated in the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits.\\nSupport items\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a worker is travelling to provide services to\\nmore than one participant in a ‘region’ then the provider should apportion the non-labour travel\\ncosts (including the return journey where applicable) between the participants, with the agreement\\nof each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

These categories can\\nbe relevant to rules for participants about how they can spend their support budgets, and for\\nproviders when seeking payment for delivered supports.\\nSupport Items\\nEach support that a provider supplies to a participant can be classified as one of the support items\\nlisted in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and in the NDIS Support Catalogue.\\nProviders should claim payments against the support item that aligns to the service they\\nhave delivered.\\nEach support item has a unique reference number, according to the following structure:\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\nFor example:\\n01_013_0107_1_1 – Assistance with Self-Care Activities – Standard – Saturday\\nSupport Sequence Registration Outcome Support\\nCategory Number Group Domain Purpose\\n01 013 0107 1 1\\nSupport Purposes\\nNDIS participant budgets are allocated to three separate support purposes:\\n1. CORE - Supports that enable participants to complete activities of daily living. Participant\\nbudgets often have a lot of flexibility to choose specific supports with their core support\\nbudgets, but cannot reallocate this funding for other support purposes (i.e., capital or\\ncapacity building supports).\\n2. CAPITAL - Investments, such as assistive technologies - equipment, home or vehicle\\nmodifications, or for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). Participant budgets for this\\nsupport purpose are restricted to specific items identified in the participant’s plan.\\n3. CAPACITY BUILDING - Supports that enable a participant to build their independence and\\nskills.\\nSupport Categories aligned to the NDIS Outcomes Framework\\nParticipant budgets are allocated at a support category level and must be used to achieve the\\ngoals set out in the participant’s plan. Support categories are aligned with the NDIS Outcomes\\nFramework, which has been developed to measure goal attainment for individual participants and\\noverall performance of the Scheme. There are eight outcome domains in the Framework, which\\nhelp participants think about goals in different areas of their life and assist planners to explore\\nwhere supports in these areas already exist and where further supports are required. These\\ndomains are:\\n1. Daily Living 5. Work\\n2. Home 6. Social and Community Participation\\n3. Health and Wellbeing 7.

Support\\npurpose categories are designed to align with the Outcomes Framework and the 15 support\\ncategories. This helps participants choose supports that help them achieve their goals, and\\nproviders to understand how the supports they provide contribute to the participant’s goals.\\nThe following table shows the links between support purpose types, domains in the Outcomes\\nFramework and support categories.\\nPURPOSE OUTCOME DOMAIN 1.

Where price limits apply to a support, prices charged to participants must\\nnot exceed the price limit prescribed for that support in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price\\nLimits. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the claims for payment that they make\\naccurately reflect the supports delivered, including the frequency, volume and type of support.\\nClaims need to be made against the specific support item that aligns to the service delivered.\\nFalsifying claims for payment is a serious compliance issue and may result in action against the\\nprovider. Providers are also required to keep accurate records of claims, which are subject to audit.\\nService Agreements\\nA Service Agreement is a formal agreement between a participant and provider. They help to\\nensure there is a shared understanding of:\\n• Expectations of what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered; and\\n• The respective responsibilities and obligations of the provider and the participant and how to\\nresolve any problems that may arise.\\nService Agreements should be simple and set out how and when supports will be delivered. They\\ncan include information such as:\\n• What supports and services the provider has agreed to provide;\\n• The prices of those supports and services;\\n• How, when and where the supports and services are provided;\\n• The duration of the Service Agreement and when and how the Agreement will be reviewed;\\n• How the participant or the provider may change or end the Service Agreement;\\n• How any problems or issues that may arise will be handled;\\n• Participant responsibilities under the Service Agreement; and\\n• Provider responsibilities under the Service Agreement.\\nProviders should not seek to impose conditions on participants through Service Agreements that\\nare not in line with those set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and its\\nassociated documents.\\nService Bookings\\nService bookings are used to set aside funding in a participant’s plan for a registered provider for a\\nsupport they will deliver. Service bookings can be made by the participant or provider in the\\nmyplace portal. Providers claim payments against the service booking in the myplace portal. Each\\nservice booking sets out the specific support items or support category delivered and period of\\nservice delivery within the plan dates. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.\\nThe Agency recommends that service bookings should be created at the category level, where\\npossible. This allows providers and participants to negotiate or access supports on a more flexible\\nbasis, especially for on-the-spot assessments or less predictable support needs. A provider must\\nhave a service booking in place to make a payment claim in the Portal. Further information\\ncan be found on the NDIS website.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 14 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\t\\n\\tA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\t\\n\\tIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\t\\n\\t$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\t\\n\\t\\tGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaiming for support items that are subject to quotation\\nProviders can only claim for a support item that is subject to quotation from a participant’s plan if\\nthey provided a quotation to the NDIA for the support item and it is a stated item in the participant’s\\nplan. When the NDIA approves a quote, then it will create a service booking for the support item\\nthat the provider can use for claiming purposes.\\nClaiming for support items that have a price limit\\nWhere a support item has a price limit then the provider cannot agree a price for the support with\\nthe participant that is greater than the price limit. Claims should be made in the units specified for\\nthe item and at the agreed unit price, which must not be higher than the applicable price limit.\\nExample – Claiming for a support subject to price limit\\nA provider has agreed to deliver a support to a participant at an hourly rate of $50.\\nIf the provider provides support for 30 minutes then they should make a claim for 0.5 hours at the agreed unit price of\\n$50. They should not claim for 1 unit at $25.\\nClaiming for support items that do not have a price limit\\nWhere a support item does not have a price limit then the provider and participant should agree on\\nthe reasonable price for the support. If necessary, they should also agree on the billing schedule\\nfor the support. For example, they might agree that a support should be claimed weekly. These\\nclaims are subject to the general claiming rules, including that, in general, supports can only be\\nclaimed for after they have been delivered.\\nThe provider should claim for that item by reference to the “notional unit price” that is set out in the\\nNDIS Support Catalogue or the NDIS Assistive Technology, Home Modifications and\\nConsumables Code Guide.\\nExample – Claiming for Low Cost AT\\nA Provider has agreed to deliver a text player to a participant at a cost of $530.\\nThe relevant support item (03_220300911_0113_1_1: Low Cost AT for Vision Related AT) is not subject to a price\\nlimit but has a “notional” unit price of $1.00.\\nThe provider would submit a payment request for 530 units at $1.00 a unit for a total amount of $530.\\nExample – Claiming for Activity Based Transport\\nThe activity based transport support items are not subject to price limits but have a “notional” unit limit of $1.00.\\nIf, as in the above example, the non-labour costs of the activity based transport was $21.50 (in this example against\\nthe support item 04_590_0125_6_1) then the provider would submit a payment request for 21.5 units at $1.00 a unit\\nfor a total cost of $21.50.\\nTime of Day and Day of Week\\nIn determining which price limit is applicable to a support, the important consideration is when the\\nsupport is provided to the participant, not the shift of the worker used to deliver that support as\\ndetermined by the applicable Industry Award or Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.\\nFor NDIS claiming purposes, the provider must first determine the day of the week on which the\\nsupport was provided on and then the time of the day during which the support was delivered.\\n(Note: weekday means Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday).\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 15 of 101'}\n",

Providers should assist participants to minimise the travel\\ncosts that they need to pay (for example, by co-ordinating appointments with other participants in\\nan area, so that travel costs can be shared between participants, or by considering the delivery of\\nthe support by telehealth where appropriate).\\nShort Notice Cancellations\\nWhere a provider has a Short Notice Cancellation (or no show), they are able to claim 100% of the\\nagreed fee associated with the activity from the participant’s plan, subject to the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits and the terms of the service agreement with the participant.\\nA cancellation is a short notice cancellation if the participant:\\n• Does not show up for a scheduled support within a reasonable time, or is not present at the\\nagreed place and within a reasonable time when the provider is travelling to deliver the\\nsupport; or\\n• Has given less than seven (7) clear days’ notice for a support.\\nFor supports delivered to a group of participants, if a participant cancels their attendance and if the\\nprovider is unable find another participant to attend the group session in their place then, if the\\nother requirements for a short notice cancellation are met, the provider is permitted to bill the\\nparticipant who has made the short notice cancellation at the previously agreed rate that they\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 22 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\t\\n\\tA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\t\\n\\tThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\t\\n\\tnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\t\\n\\twould have been spent providing the support.\\t\\n\\tIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\t\\n\\tprovider can claim for this support.

All other participants in the group\\nshould also be billed as though all participants had attended the group.\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a Short Notice Cancellation of the delivery of\\na support item to the participant if all of the following conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for Short\\nNotice Cancellations in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify that Short Notice Cancellations can be\\nclaimed); and\\n• The provider was not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and are\\nrequired to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.\\nClaims for a short notice cancellation should be made using the same support item as would have\\nbeen used if the support had been delivered, using the “Cancellation” option in the myplace portal.\\nThere is no hard limit on the number of short notice cancellations (or no shows) for which a\\nprovider can claim in respect of a participant. However, providers have a duty of care to their\\nparticipants and if a participant has an unusual number of cancellations, then the provider should\\nseek to understand why they are occurring. The NDIA will monitor claims for cancellations and may\\ncontact providers who have a participant with an unusual number of cancellations.\\nExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\nA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\nThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\nnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\nwould have been spent providing the support.\\nIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\nprovider can claim for this support. The claim should be made at the agreed rate for the service against the relevant\\nsupport item using the drop-down field “Cancellation”.\\nNDIA Requested Reports\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a NDIA Requested Report if all of the\\nfollowing conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for NDIA\\nRequested Reports in respect of that support item and the proposed charges for the activities\\ncomply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (i.e., the service agreement\\nwith the participant should specify that NDIA Requested Reports can be claimed); and\\n• The report is requested by the NDIA.\\nA report is considered to have been requested by the NDIA if it is a report that is required at the\\ncommencement of a plan that outlines plan objectives and goals, or at plan review that measures\\nfunctional outcomes against the originally stipulated goals, or that makes recommendations for\\nongoing needs (informal, community, mainstream or funded supports). Providers may also claim\\nfor other NDIA-requested therapy report that is stipulated as being required in a participant’s plan.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 23 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaims for NDIS requested reports should be made using the relevant support item, using the\\n“NDIA Report” option in the myplace portal.\\nClaiming for Activity Based Transport\\nActivity Based Transport – Social, Economic and Community Participation Supports\\nProviders of supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation\\nSupport Category (“community participation supports”) can, at the request of a participant,\\ntransport a participant to, or from, or as part of, a community participation support. In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

Providers should assist participants to minimise the travel\\ncosts that they need to pay (for example, by co-ordinating appointments with other participants in\\nan area, so that travel costs can be shared between participants, or by considering the delivery of\\nthe support by telehealth where appropriate).\\nShort Notice Cancellations\\nWhere a provider has a Short Notice Cancellation (or no show), they are able to claim 100% of the\\nagreed fee associated with the activity from the participant’s plan, subject to the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits and the terms of the service agreement with the participant.\\nA cancellation is a short notice cancellation if the participant:\\n• Does not show up for a scheduled support within a reasonable time, or is not present at the\\nagreed place and within a reasonable time when the provider is travelling to deliver the\\nsupport; or\\n• Has given less than seven (7) clear days’ notice for a support.\\nFor supports delivered to a group of participants, if a participant cancels their attendance and if the\\nprovider is unable find another participant to attend the group session in their place then, if the\\nother requirements for a short notice cancellation are met, the provider is permitted to bill the\\nparticipant who has made the short notice cancellation at the previously agreed rate that they\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 22 of 101\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\t\\n\\tA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\t\\n\\tThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\t\\n\\tnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\t\\n\\twould have been spent providing the support.\\t\\n\\tIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\t\\n\\tprovider can claim for this support.

All other participants in the group\\nshould also be billed as though all participants had attended the group.\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a Short Notice Cancellation of the delivery of\\na support item to the participant if all of the following conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for Short\\nNotice Cancellations in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify that Short Notice Cancellations can be\\nclaimed); and\\n• The provider was not able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and are\\nrequired to pay the worker for the time that would have been spent providing the support.\\nClaims for a short notice cancellation should be made using the same support item as would have\\nbeen used if the support had been delivered, using the “Cancellation” option in the myplace portal.\\nThere is no hard limit on the number of short notice cancellations (or no shows) for which a\\nprovider can claim in respect of a participant. However, providers have a duty of care to their\\nparticipants and if a participant has an unusual number of cancellations, then the provider should\\nseek to understand why they are occurring. The NDIA will monitor claims for cancellations and may\\ncontact providers who have a participant with an unusual number of cancellations.\\nExample – Short Notice Cancellation\\nA one-hour support is scheduled for 10 am on a Tuesday following a Public Holiday Monday.\\nThe participant cancels the support after 10 am on the Thursday before the Public Holiday Monday and the provider is\\nnot able to find alternative billable work for the relevant worker and is required to pay the worker for the time that\\nwould have been spent providing the support.\\nIf the Service Agreement between the participant and the provider has included cancellation arrangements then the\\nprovider can claim for this support. The claim should be made at the agreed rate for the service against the relevant\\nsupport item using the drop-down field “Cancellation”.\\nNDIA Requested Reports\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for a NDIA Requested Report if all of the\\nfollowing conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for NDIA\\nRequested Reports in respect of that support item and the proposed charges for the activities\\ncomply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits; and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (i.e., the service agreement\\nwith the participant should specify that NDIA Requested Reports can be claimed); and\\n• The report is requested by the NDIA.\\nA report is considered to have been requested by the NDIA if it is a report that is required at the\\ncommencement of a plan that outlines plan objectives and goals, or at plan review that measures\\nfunctional outcomes against the originally stipulated goals, or that makes recommendations for\\nongoing needs (informal, community, mainstream or funded supports). Providers may also claim\\nfor other NDIA-requested therapy report that is stipulated as being required in a participant’s plan.\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 23 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\nClaims for NDIS requested reports should be made using the relevant support item, using the\\n“NDIA Report” option in the myplace portal.\\nClaiming for Activity Based Transport\\nActivity Based Transport – Social, Economic and Community Participation Supports\\nProviders of supports in the Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation\\nSupport Category (“community participation supports”) can, at the request of a participant,\\ntransport a participant to, or from, or as part of, a community participation support. In these cases,\\nthe provider is entitled, with the agreement of the participant, to bill the participant’s plan for the\\ntime that support workers spend providing the transport support (as part of the community\\nparticipation support). They are also entitled to bill for any non-labour costs associated with\\ntransporting the participant (again, as part of the community participation support).\\nThe worker’s time can be claimed at the agreed hourly rate for the relevant support item for the\\ntotal time the worker provides support to one or more participants, including time spent\\naccompanying and/or transporting the participant. Where a provider is transporting two or more\\nparticipants on the same trip, the worker’s time should be apportioned amongst participants. This\\nclaim should be made using the relevant community participation support item and against the\\nparticipant’s core budget.\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when accompanying and/or\\ntransporting participants in the community (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs\\nof the vehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The following is a guide as to what these contributions might be:\\n• For a vehicle that is not modified for accessibility, up to $0.97 a kilometre;\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\n• For a vehicle that is modified for accessibility or a bus, up to $2.76 a kilometre;\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, and public\\ntransport fares, up to the full amount.\\nSupport items\\nThese non-labour costs should be claimed against the relevant activity-based transport support\\nitem. These support items can be delivered to individual participants and to groups of participants\\nsubject to the rules set out in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a provider is\\ntransporting two or more participants on the same trip, these additional costs should be\\napportioned amongst participants, with the agreement of each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

However, research\\nundertaken by a capacity-building provider specifically linked to the needs of a participant and to\\nthe achievement of the participant’s goals may be billable as a Non-Face-to-Face support with the\\nparticipant’s prior agreement.\\nService agreements with each client can ‘pre-authorise’ these activities, but providers should only\\nclaim a support item from a participant’s plan if they have completed activities that are part of the\\nsupport for that participant. Charging a fee that is not linked to completed activities is not permitted.\\nTime spent on administration, such as the processing of NDIS payment claims for all clients,\\nshould not be claimed from a participant’s budget as a Non-Face-to-Face support. The NDIS price\\nlimits include an allowance for overheads, including the costs of administration tasks. Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel. The non-labour costs should be claimed against the\\nrelevant “Provider Travel – non-labour costs” support item as indicated in the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits.\\nSupport items\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a worker is travelling to provide services to\\nmore than one participant in a ‘region’ then the provider should apportion the non-labour travel\\ncosts (including the return journey where applicable) between the participants, with the agreement\\nof each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

However, research\\nundertaken by a capacity-building provider specifically linked to the needs of a participant and to\\nthe achievement of the participant’s goals may be billable as a Non-Face-to-Face support with the\\nparticipant’s prior agreement.\\nService agreements with each client can ‘pre-authorise’ these activities, but providers should only\\nclaim a support item from a participant’s plan if they have completed activities that are part of the\\nsupport for that participant. Charging a fee that is not linked to completed activities is not permitted.\\nTime spent on administration, such as the processing of NDIS payment claims for all clients,\\nshould not be claimed from a participant’s budget as a Non-Face-to-Face support. The NDIS price\\nlimits include an allowance for overheads, including the costs of administration tasks. Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel. The non-labour costs should be claimed against the\\nrelevant “Provider Travel – non-labour costs” support item as indicated in the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits.\\nSupport items\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a worker is travelling to provide services to\\nmore than one participant in a ‘region’ then the provider should apportion the non-labour travel\\ncosts (including the return journey where applicable) between the participants, with the agreement\\nof each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

Charging a fee that is not linked to completed activities is not permitted.\\nTime spent on administration, such as the processing of NDIS payment claims for all clients,\\nshould not be claimed from a participant’s budget as a Non-Face-to-Face support. The NDIS price\\nlimits include an allowance for overheads, including the costs of administration tasks. Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel. The non-labour costs should be claimed against the\\nrelevant “Provider Travel – non-labour costs” support item as indicated in the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits.\\nSupport items\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a worker is travelling to provide services to\\nmore than one participant in a ‘region’ then the provider should apportion the non-labour travel\\ncosts (including the return journey where applicable) between the participants, with the agreement\\nof each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.

This support item\\nincludes up to two hours of active supports provided to the participant for the duration of the period.\\nProviders may claim for the third or additional hour at Saturday rates on weekdays, or at applicable\\nrates on other days (Saturday, Sunday or Public Holidays).\\nNote, there is no night-time sleepover support item for nurses.\\nClaiming for Telehealth Services\\nTelehealth can be used to deliver direct supports where appropriate and with the agreement of the\\nparticipant.\\nProviders can only claim Telehealth Services where the following conditions are met:\\n• The delivery of the support by telehealth is appropriate; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and with the Service Agreement with the participant; and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant (rather\\nthan a general activity such as enrolment, administration or staff rostering); and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider specifies that Telehealth services can be claimed).\\nProviders have a duty of care to their participants to ensure they are providing the same standard\\nof care through video technology as in a clinical setting.\\nClaims for Telehealth Services should be made using the relevant support item as indicated in\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits by using the “Telehealth Services” option in the\\nmyplace portal.\\nClaiming for Non-direct Services\\nNon-Face-to-Face Support Provision\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for the Non-Face-to-Face delivery of a support\\nitem if all of the following conditions are met:\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for Non-\\nFace-to-Face Support Provision in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and with the Service Agreement with the participant; and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant or in\\nthe case of group-based supports, are required to enable the group support to be delivered\\n(rather than a general activity such as enrolment, administration or staff rostering); and\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 17 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the service agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider specifies that Non-Face-to-Face supports can be\\nclaimed).\\nFor example, the Assistance with Self Care support items are described as covering activities\\n“Assisting with, and/or supervising, personal tasks of daily life to develop skills of the participant to\\nlive as autonomously as possible”. Therefore, time spent on Non-Face-to-Face activities that assist\\nthe participant – for example, writing reports for co-workers and other providers about the client’s\\nprogress with skill development – could be claimed against this support item.\\nThe costs of training and up-skilling staff, and of supervision, are included in the base price limits\\nfor supports and are not considered billable Non-Face-to-Face supports. However, research\\nundertaken by a capacity-building provider specifically linked to the needs of a participant and to\\nthe achievement of the participant’s goals may be billable as a Non-Face-to-Face support with the\\nparticipant’s prior agreement.\\nService agreements with each client can ‘pre-authorise’ these activities, but providers should only\\nclaim a support item from a participant’s plan if they have completed activities that are part of the\\nsupport for that participant. Charging a fee that is not linked to completed activities is not permitted.\\nTime spent on administration, such as the processing of NDIS payment claims for all clients,\\nshould not be claimed from a participant’s budget as a Non-Face-to-Face support. The NDIS price\\nlimits include an allowance for overheads, including the costs of administration tasks. Examples of\\nadministrative activities that are covered by the overhead component of the support price limits and\\nthat should not be billed as Non-Face-to-Face supports include, but are not limited to:\\n• Pre-engagement visits;\\n• Developing and agreeing Service Agreements;\\n• Entering or amending participant details into system;\\n• Making participant service time changes;\\n• Staff / participant travel monitoring and adjustment;\\n• Ongoing NDIS plan monitoring;\\n• Completing a quoting tool;\\n• Making service bookings; and\\n• Making payment claims.\\nThe fee charged for Non-Face-To-Face supports must be reflective of the needs of the participant\\nin the context of the relevant support, and in agreement with the participant.\\nClaims for Non-Face-to-Face supports are made using the relevant support item, using the “Non-\\nFace-to-Face” option in the myplace portal.\\nProvider Travel\\nProviders can only claim from a participant’s plan for travel costs in respect of the delivery of a\\nsupport item if all of the following conditions are met:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 18 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits indicates that providers can claim for\\nProvider Travel in respect of that support item; and\\n• The proposed charges for the activities comply with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and\\nPrice Limits and\\n• The activities are part of delivering a specific disability support item to that participant; and\\n• The support is delivered directly (face-to-face) to the participant; and\\n• The provider explains the activities to the participant, including why they represent the best\\nuse of the participant’s funds (that is, the provider explains the value of these activities to the\\nparticipant); and\\n• The provider has the agreement of the participant in advance (that is, the Agreement\\nbetween the participant and provider should specify the travel costs that can be claimed);\\nand\\n• The provider is required to pay the worker delivering the support for the time they spent\\ntravelling as a result of the agreement under which the worker is employed; or the provider is\\na sole trader and is travelling from their usual place of work to or from the participant, or\\nbetween participants.\\nProvider Travel – Labour Costs (Time)\\nWhere a provider claims for travel time in respect of a support then the maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent travelling to each participant (for each eligible worker) is\\n30 minutes in MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM\\nclassification is the classification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nIn addition to the above travel, providers delivering core and capacity-building supports are\\npermitted to claim for provider travel in respect of a support item can also claim for the time spent\\ntravelling from the last participant to their usual place of work. Note, this travel is only claimable\\nwhen the provider must pay their worker for the return travel time. The maximum amount of travel\\ntime that they can claim for the time spent on return travel (for each eligible worker) is 30 minutes\\nin MMM1-3 areas and 60 minutes in MMM4-5 areas. (Note the relevant MMM classification is the\\nclassification of the area where the participant is when the support is delivered.)\\nWhere a worker is travelling to provide services to more than one participant in a ‘region’, then it is\\nreasonable for a provider to apportion all of the travel time (including the return journey where\\napplicable) between the participants who received support from the worker. This apportionment\\nshould be agreed with each participant in advance as part of the service agreement.\\nClaims for travel in respect of a support must be made separately to the claim for the primary\\nsupport (the support for which the travel is necessary) using the same line item as the primary\\nsupport and the “Provider Travel” option in the myplace portal. When claiming for travel in respect\\nof a support, a provider should use the same hourly rate as they have agreed with the participant\\nfor the primary support (or a lower hourly rate for the travel if that is what they have agreed with the\\nparticipant) in calculating the claimable travel cost.\\nProvider Travel – Non-Labour Costs\\nIf a provider incurs costs, in addition to the cost of a worker’s time, when travelling to deliver Face-\\nto-Face supports to a participant (such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of the\\nvehicle), they may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution\\ntowards these costs. The NDIA considers that the following would be reasonable contributions:\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0 (published 16/06/2023) Page 19 of 101\\nGeneral Claiming Rules\\n• For a vehicle owned by the provider or the worker, up to $0.97 a kilometre; and\\n• For other forms of transport or associated costs, such as road tolls, parking, public transport\\nfares, up to the full amount.\\nClaims can only be made for the non-labour costs associated with provider travel in respect of a\\nsupport where the rules governing provider travel allow a claim for provider travel time to be made.\\nClaims for the non-labour costs of provider travel in respect of a support must be made separately\\nto the claim for the primary support (the support for which the travel is necessary) and for the travel\\ntime associated with the provider travel. The non-labour costs should be claimed against the\\nrelevant “Provider Travel – non-labour costs” support item as indicated in the NDIS Pricing\\nArrangements and Price Limits.\\nSupport items\\nThese support items can be delivered to individual participants subject to the rules set out in the\\nNDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits. Where a worker is travelling to provide services to\\nmore than one participant in a ‘region’ then the provider should apportion the non-labour travel\\ncosts (including the return journey where applicable) between the participants, with the agreement\\nof each participant in advance.\\nThese support items are not subject to price limits.
