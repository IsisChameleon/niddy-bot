      "\n",
      "1. The item code 01_608_0114_1_1 is for a Saturday service delivered during the day. The maximum prices you can charge are $189.02 (National), $264.63 (Remote), and $283.53 (Very Remote).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The item code 01_611_0114_1_1 is for a Weekday Night service. The maximum prices you can charge are $164.42 (National), $230.19 (Remote), and $246.63 (Very Remote).\n",

      "\n",
      "So, if your service on Saturday extends into the night (after 6.00 pm), you should use the Weekday Night item code. If your service is completed before 6.00 pm, you should use the Saturday item code. \n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that these prices are subject to the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits 2023-24 Version 1.0.\n",

      "Assistant: The NDIS price guide differentiates between \"Weekday Night\" and \"Saturday\" or \"Sunday\" to account for different support needs and potential additional costs associated with providing services during these times. \n",
      "\n",
      "A \"Weekday Night\" refers to any support that commences on or after 6.00 pm on a Weekday and finishes before 7.30 am on the following day. This excludes Public Holidays.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, a \"Saturday\" or \"Sunday\" support refers to any support that starts at or after midnight on the night prior to a Saturday or Sunday and ends before or at midnight of that Saturday or Sunday. This excludes Public Holidays and Night-time Sleepover Support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, even though Saturday night is technically a night, within the context of the NDIS price guide, it is categorized separately from \"Weekday Night\". This distinction allows for different pricing structures and considerations for supports provided during these times.\n",
